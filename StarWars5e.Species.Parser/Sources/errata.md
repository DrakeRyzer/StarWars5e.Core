### Biology and Appearance
Ortolans are squat, heavily-built humanoid bipeds with long, trunklike noses and beady black eyes. They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body. Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their business affairs by their attachment to food, sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find success as chefs or musicians. 

### Society and Culture
Ortolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education.<br><br>While most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.

### Names
Ortolan names are generally short with big sounds. Female names are typically softer. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Donmb, Hegh, Nax, Parm, Teeb

### Biology and Appearance
Codru-Ji are humanoids generally near-Human in their adult appearances, save for their four arms. While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.<br><br>Codru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent. They do, however, retain both the natural resilience and the enhanced hearing of their previous selves.

### Society and Culture
The Codru-Ji are proud and protective of their ancient customs, and they carefully manage their homeworld's economy to keep a degree of anonymity from the galaxy at large. They fear the tainting of their long-held practices by outside influence as well as prejudice against them for the almost barbaric level of callousness they will display towards one another in pursuit of personal gain. The kidnapping of a political rivals' children or the ransoming of off-worlders back to their people are both common practices. 

### Names
Codru-Ji names are often kept to two syllables. Clan names are appended to the given name as a hyphenated affix.

**Male Names.** Kossok, Tirrit, Uttar, Yunnan

**Female Names.** Davvi, Kella, Russa, Zollu 

**Clan Names.** -Fa, -Mu, Ro-, -Sy, Yi-

### Codru-Ji Traits
As a Codru-Ji, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Codru-Ji reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Steeped in selfish tradition, Codru-Ji tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Codru-Ji stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Four-Armed.*** Codru-Ji have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

***Natural Grappler.*** Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple you are considered proficient in the Athletics skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Trance.*** Codru-Ji sleep lightly, standing and semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Codruese, which has a solemn and stately cadence to it.

### Biology and Appearance
Squibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.

### Society and Culture
Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with literal regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.

### Names
Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.

**Names.** Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior

**Nicknames.** Galan, Meela, Wilpher

### Squib Traits
As a Squib, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Squibs reach adulthood at nine years of age and live an average of sixty-five years.

***Alignment.*** Squibs' cheerful nature causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Squibs typically stand 3 to 3 and a half feet tall and weigh around 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.

***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Squibs is their desire and love of haggling. Squibs believe a deal is done when both sides believe they got the better of the other. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered proficient in the Persuasion skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Flexible Cheeks.***  Squibs have flexible cheeks in which they can store small goods. You can store up to two items that weigh a combined total of no more than 2 lb. in your cheeks, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal them.

***Hide.*** Your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Sensitive Fur.*** Squibs' fur is exceptionally sensitive to physical details. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on touch.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Squibbian. The Squibbian language originated as a secret form of communication for Squibs to convey information without being understood.
