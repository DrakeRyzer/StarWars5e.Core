&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">hese weapons are not playthings. A lightsaber is a</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dangerous and destructive instrument, a powerful blade that can strike down an opponent—or a friend, if you're not careful." <p align=right>- Luke Skywalker</p>

___

While the guardian is the master of lightsaber forms, in reality all lightsaber-wielding Jedi and Sith use them, if not with the same level of focus. If a character is proficient with lightweapons, has the ability to cast force powers, and comes from an appropriate background, consider utilizing the following variant rule.

### Practitioner of the Forms
You are skilled with each of the known forms of lightsaber combat. While you are wielding a lightweapon with which you are proficient, as a bonus action on each of your turns you can adopt one of the forms, granting you a benefit determined by the form.

#### Form I: Shii-Sho
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting.

Additionally, the first time you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon attack before the start of your next turn, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately<br> move into the space it just vacated without<br> provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Form II: Makashi
Until the start of your next turn, when a creature makes a melee weapon attack against you and misses, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against that creature.

#### Form III: Soresu
Until the start of your next turn, you have<br> resistance to the first kinetic or energy<br> damage you take from unenhanced<br> weapons.

#### Form IV: Ataru
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this<br> form, you can leap up to 15 feet to an<br> unoccupied space you can see.

#### Form V: Djem So
Until the start of your next turn, you can add<br> half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier<br> (your choice, rounded down) to the<br> next ability check or attack roll you<br> make using Strength. 

\columnbreak

#### Form VI: Niman
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting. 

Additionally, if you hit with a weapon attack before the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll of the next force power your cast before the end of your next turn.

#### Form VII: Juyo
Until the start of your next turn, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

#### Form VIII: Sokan
Until the start of your next turn, you ignore difficult terrain. Additionally, when an opponent makes a melee weapon attack against you, you can use your reaction to move to another space within 5 feet of that opponent without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the roll.

#### Form IX: Tràkata
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, you can flourish your weapon to attempt to distract an enemy you can see. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by a Wisdom (Perception) check of one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. On a success, that creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you.

#### Form X: Jar'Kai
As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting. If the attack hits, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

# Advanced Advantage and Flanking

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ypically, multiple instances of advantage or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disadvantage don't stack; you either have it or you don't, and if you have both, you essentially have neither. This variant rule is designed to allow sources of advantage—and disadvantage—to stack, to a maximum of three times.

When you have two sources of advantage, you instead have **superadvantage**, which allows you to roll two additional d20s when you make your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and take the highest of the three dice. If you have three sources of advantage, however, you instead have **hyperadvantage**, which allows you to roll three additionals d20s and take the highest of the four. Consequently, if you have two sources of disadvantage, you instead have **superdisadvantage**, and if you have three sources of disadvantage, you have **hyperdisadvantage**, rolling three and four d20s, respectively, and taking the lowest.

Additionally, advantage and disadvantage no longer completely cancel each other out. Instead, if you have two sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage, you instead have one source of advantage. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage—superadvantage—when you make your attack roll. If the creature is heavily obscured from you, however, you would have disadvantage on the attack roll, shifting you from superadvantage to advantage.

Each source of advantage or disadvantage must be unique. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage—superadvantage—when you make your attack roll. If another ally also takes the Help action, however, you still only have two unique sources of advantage, thus granting only superadvantage.

> Some customization options, such as the Supreme Accuracy feat, grant bonuses if you would have advantage. If you elect to use this variant rule, adjust these customization options to instead grant an additional source of advantage if you would already have advantage. For instance, if you have the Supreme Accuracy feat, if you have no source of advantage, you gain no benefit from the second bullet of the feat. If you have a source of advantage, however, the feat instead grants you superadvantage (or potentially hyperadvantage if you have an additional source of advantage).

### Passive Checks
When determining your total for a passive check with this variant rule, if you have superadvantage on a check, add 8. For superdisadvantage, subtract 8. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, add 10, and if you have hyperdisadvantage, subtract 10.

\columnbreak

## Flanking
When multiple creatures within 5 feet of another creature engage it in combat, that creature may become flanked. This variant rule offers mechanical boons to flanking that work alongside Advanced Advantage, but can be used completely separately.

A target who is **half flanked** suffers a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws against sources within 5 feet of it. A target is half flanked if it is at least half surrounded, either to a side, above, or below.

A target who is **three-quarters flanked** suffers a -5 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws against sources within 5 feet of it. A target is three-quarters flanked if it is at least three-quarters surrounded, either to a side, above, or below.

> Alternatively, you can have players add a +2 or +5 bonus to their attack rolls against creatures who are half or three-quarters flanked, respectively, by them.. Additionally, if you use the Saving Throws Checks variant from page 250 of the *Star Wars* 5th Edition Player's Handbook, you can instead have them add a +2 or +5 bonus to their Dexterity saving throw checks against creatures who are half or three-quarters flanked, respectively, by them.

A creature who has a reach of greater than 5 feet gains the benefit of flanking against a creature while within melee range, but does not contribute towards flanking unless they are within 5 feet of the target.

***Flanking on Squares.*** On a square grid, a Small or Medium creature takes up one square, and has eight squares surrounding it within 5 feet. When four or five of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered half flanked by those creatures. If six or more of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is instead considered three-quarters flanked.

***Flanking on Hexes.*** On a hex grid, a Small or Medium creature takes up one hex, and has six hexes surrounding it within 5 feet. When three or four of those squares are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is considered half flanked by those creatures. If five or six of those hexes are occupied by hostile creatures, that creature is instead considered three-quarters flanked.

> Alternatively, you can run the simpler ruleset for flanking found in the DMG, that offers advantage instead of flat bonuses. That ruleset works alongside Advanced Advantage as well.

# Force Alignment

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he Force is manifested by two powerful and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opposing aspects: the Ashla and the Bogan, more commonly known as the light side and the dark. As force-wielding characters evolve throughout the game, they can gravitate towards one side or the other (or neither, should they choose), resulting in physical manifestations and boons.

### Alignment Score
How much a character embodies an aspect of the Force is calculated using their Alignment Score. The Alignment Score is an ever-shifting value falling between Light 100 to Dark 100. Characters gain an Alignment Score by gaining Light/Dark Points, as determined by their actions.

### Gaining Light/Dark Points
When a character performs an act associated with one side of the Force, they gain points accordingly. Players can gain Light Points through a multitude of actions:
- The first time you cast a light side force power of 1st-level or higher, you gain Light Points equal to the power's level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Light Point.
- Committing selfless acts, such as deliberately saving others at the expense of yourself, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.
- Other benevolent acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.

Consequently, players can also gain Dark Points through various actions:
- The first time you cast a dark side force power of 1st-level or higher you gain Dark Points equal to the power’s level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Dark Point.
- Committing truly heinous acts, such as harming or murdering an innocent, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.
- Other evil acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.

If a character has a score and performs an opposing act, instead of gaining points towards the other aspect of the Force, they lose them from their current score. For instance, if a player has 5 Light Points, and casts a dark side power of 4th level, they would have their Light Points reduced to 1. If the player instead casts a dark side power of 7th level, their score would shift to Dark 2.

## Alignment Tiers
As you earn Light/Dark Points, you reach certain tiers of Alignment Score that manifest themselves in varying ways. If you ever fall below the Light/Dark Points threshold for a Major tier, you immediately lose that tier's benefits. You regain the benefits when you meet the criteria again. Minor tier effects are permanent unless another similar effect occurs.

### Minor Benevolence/Corruption
At certain tiers of Light/Dark Points, you risk manifesting Minor Traits, as shown in the Force Alignment table. When you would earn a Minor Trait, you must first make a saving throw (Charisma for Benevolence, Wisdom for Corruption), the DC of which varies depending on the tier of the Minor Trait, as shown in the Minor Benevolence/Corruption Save DC table below. On a failed save, you must roll on a Minor Benevolence/Corruption tables, depending on the tier of the Minor Benevolence/Corruption. You can choose to fail this saving throw, if you wish.

##### Minor Benevolence/Corruption Save DC
| Minor Benevolence/Corruption Tier | Save DC |
|:--|:-:|
| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier I)     | 12 |
| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier II)    | 14 |
| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier III)   | 16 |
| Minor Benevolence/Corruption (Tier IV)    | 18 |

# Destiny

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/XSXXqiB.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:70px;width:39px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;estiny plays a large role in the *Star Wars*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; universe. As a young boy, Anakin Skywalker is told that his destiny is to bring about balance to the Force. Padme's destiny is to give birth to the twins, Luka and Leia, so that they can fulfil their own destinies. Luke Skywalker learns that his destiny is to redeem his father, Darth Vader, so that balance to the Force is restored. Leia's destiny is to save the Rebellion from annihilation at the hands of the Empire and help forge the New Republic. The destiny mechanic helps players and GMs recognize that all heroes - and even major villains - have significant roles to play in the fate of the galaxy. Destiny rewards players for good roleplaying and gives GM new plot hooks to use when designing adventures.

The rules presented below are optional. A GM may decide to use Destiny Points or not; however, the decision to use them should be made before the campaign gets underway, so that each player can decide whether or not to embrace a destiny for their character from the outset.

## Choosing a Destiny
Players don't need to choose destinies for their heroes at the start of the campaign - or ever for that matter. Not every hero has a destiny that must be fulfilled before the end of the campaign, and even players who want their characters to have destinies need to give their characters - and the campaign - a chance to develop first. It may take several adventures before players understand where the campaign is going and what goals their heroes are likely to pursue.

Choosing a destiny can be handled in one of two ways: either the player can select an appropriate destiny for their hero (based on what's happening in the campaign), or the GM can select a secret destiny for the hero. If the player chooses a destiny for their character, the GM should challenge the player to fulfil their destiny by presenting conflicting situations where the smartest and most beneficial decision might force the character to choose between doing what is best for their fellow heroes and taking steps towards their destiny. If the GM secretly chooses the hero's destiny, they must present challenges that let the character move closer to achieving their destiny, imparting benefits when the character is moving in the right direction and imposing penalties when the character does something that takes them far from the destined path. The GM-selected "secret destiny" forces the player to take their character through a period of self-discovery, as they learn which action leads them closer to - or farther from - their destiny. In essence, this mirrors Luke Skywalker's struggle at the end of *The Empire Strikes Back*, when he must choose between redeeming his father and falling prey to the corruption of the dark side.

\columnbreak

&emsp;A character with a destiny gains short-term benefits whenever they make significant progress towards fulfilling it, while a character who pursues goals that move them further away from their destiny suffers short-term negative effects. Conversely, a character without a destiny has nothing to gain and nothing to lose. A character may even fulfill one destiny and take on another.

The GM and players should work together to determine a destiny's impact on a campaign. One or more destinies might form the driving force for an entire campaign, or the central focus of a short series of adventures. In one of these cases, the GM should present the characters with choices that regularly affect their destinies, giving them many opportunities to gain destiny bonuses and penalties. Destiny-based campaigns shuold culminate in a final adventure that allows characters to ultimately resolve their destinies, for better or for worse.

## Destiny Points
Destiny Points are a resource that a player can use to help fulfil whatever destiny has been set before their character. You either have a Destiny Point or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple Destiny Points for later use.

### Destiny Bonus
When a character accomplishes a goal or performs a task that clearly moves them closer to fulfilling their destiny (GM's determination), they gain a Destiny Point.

### Destiny Penalty
When a character does something that clearly moves them away from their destiny (GM's determination), they lose their Destiny Point if they currently have one. If not, the GM gains one Destiny Point to be used against them.

If the character makes steps towards their destiny once more, this GM Destiny Point should first be discarded instead of awarding the player with one.

### Final Destiny
When the moment or encounter of a character's final destiny is upon them (GM's determination) their Destiny Point is not expended upon use and may be used repeatedly. Examples of such a situation include Luke Skywalker at the Battle of Yavin, or Revan upon facing Darth Malak onboard the Star Forge.

### Destiny Fulfilled
When a character fulfils their destiny, they gain permanent benefits. Sometimes fulfilling a destiny has other effects as well; these are also covered here.

<div class='footnote'>EXPANDED CONTENT | VARIANT RULES | DESTINY</div>

\pagebreak

### Spending Destiny Points
Spending a Destiny Point does not take an action and grants one of the following benefits:
* Gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
* Impose disadvantage on an enemy attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (even once the attack is resolved).
* Act out of turn (thus changing yor position in the intiative order).
* Take damage that would otherwise harm another character within your reach.
* Immediately gain 2 of a consumable class resource (rage, force points, tech points, superiority dice, or focus)

## Sample Destinies
The following sample destinies should provide a starting point for any character wishing to take advantage of the destiny rules. Each destiny includes a brief description, with examples.

### Champion
Your destiny requires your to become leader of a large and/or significant group or organization and successfully lead it through an extremely threatening event. Characters who have this destiny might or might not know of the group they are destined to lead. They must attain this goal through a mixture of training, charisma, experience and political maneuvering. The GM might want to divide this into two destinies: attaining leadership and leading the group through troubled times.

Examples of this destiny include Mon Mothma leading the Rebel Alliance, Darth Sidious gaining control of the Republic, Wedge Antilles leading Rogue Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar escaping Grand Moff Tarkin and eventually taking command of the Rebel Fleet.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
You receive a permanent 2 increase to your Charisma score.

> ##### Sample Champion Destiny: Recruiting
> Your destiny is to convince an influential person or group to secretly aid or openly join the resistance effort on a planet or in a sector. The person or group must have considerable authority and resources, and thus be able to operate behind a thick wall of underlings and bureacracy. The group might be a far-reaching criminal organization that has agents, established rackets, transports, and cover facilities throughout a sector. It could be a corporation that could lend its financial and material support to a local rebellion. Perhaps the hero encourages an influential military, government, or corporate leader currently serving the Empire to defect and aid the resistance. Convincing this entity to change its allied or neutral stance towards the Empire requires the hero to undertake missions to earn that individual's trust.

\columnbreak

### Corruption
Your destiny is to corrupt an individual, organization, or location. You may seek to turn a person to the dark side or indoctrinate a group of people in the ways of evil. Your destiny may also be to become corrupted yourself, either by another character, an organisation, or a series of life-changing events that unfold over time. The corruption should be a long-term goal requiring a great deal of time and effort.

Examples of this destiny include the Emperor's corruption of Anakin Skywalker, a dark force-wielder transforming a Jedi shrine into a temple of evil, or an Imperial officer convincing an Alliance cell to betray the Rebellion.

Additionally, a character's destiny may be to allow themselves to be corrupted by the dark side; their fall into darkness becomes the path to achieving this destiny.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
Increase two ability scores of your choice by 1 each. In addition, if you are using the variant Dark Side Corruption rules, consult the Dark Side Corruption table.

### Creation
Your destiny requires you to create an object, machine, or other item of great power or significant use. You must use this item in support of another character's destiny, or in a future destiny of your own. Others might help create the actual item, so long as you lead and make a significant contribution to the effort. Pursuing this destiny might require you to seek out rare or restricted materials, expert advice, and adequate construction facilities or shops.

Examples of this destiny include Grand Moff Tarkin and the construction of the Death Star, Raith Sienar and the TIE fighter, and Walex Blissex and the *Victory*-class Star Destroyers.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
Once per short rest, you or any ally within line of sight can take two actions in a single round while performing an action using the created object.

### Destruction
Your destiny is to destroy a person or object, for good or evil. A Rebel agent's destiny might be to destroy a tyrannical Imperial Moff presiding over his home planet, while a darkside may be destined to destroy a powerful Jedi training site used to bolster the ranks of the Jedi order. The target of this destiny should be something very difficult to reach, either because it's heavily guarded or well hidden. Example of this destiny include Darth Vader's destruction of the Emperor, Lando Calrissian's destruction of the Death Star II, or A-wing pilot Arvel Crynyd's destruction of the *Executor*.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
Increase one ability score of your choice by +2.

### Discovery
Your destiny is to discover a person, species, object, or location that was either previously lost or unknown to the civilized galaxy. This could be as simple as seeking out the remains of a long-dead hero, or as rare as finding a vergence in the Force. A scout's destiny might be to find a thus-far-uncharted world that helps solve a galactic crisis, while a scoundrel's destiny might be to chart a new route through th Deep Core, allowing the Rebel Alliance to sneak past the Empire's security web. The thing being discovered should be something that can only be found as the result of a long-term search or serendipitous events that only occure because the character long ago set down the path that would lead to that discovery.

Examples of thise destiny include Qui-Gon Jinn's discovery of Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine or Kyle Katarn's discovery of the Valley of the Jedi.

> ##### Sample Discovery Destiny:
> ##### Base of Resistance
> Your destiny requires you to establish a hidden base that provides a safe haven and support for resistance fighters in a specific region. You might need to locate a new world that could accommodate a secret base or find a concealed facility on a known world from which dissenters covertly operate agains the Empire. You might need to gather allies and create secret support networks to maintain the base, supply it with equipment and weapons, and provide transportation for resistance forces. The scope of this destiny varies; it might be enough to establish a secret gathering place and a supply depot to aid resistance fighters in a single city, or it might require the construction of a major base to support operations in an entire system or even a sector.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
You gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.

### Education
Your destiny is to train or educate another being or group of beings in some way. In some cases, this could mean taking a young Padawan learner and molding them into an eventual Jedi Master, or it could mean training fresh-faced Rebel Alliance recruits and molding them into a crack team of SpecForce operatives. Characters with this destiny are not merely teachers providing mundane training. The education that this destiny demands must be of great importance to the galaxy, and should lay the groundwork for the beneficiaries of your tutelage to go on to fulfil destinies of their own. Only when the training is complete can this destiny be fulfilled, and the process should take months or years to complete.

Examples of this destiny include Obi-Wan Kenobi's training of Anakin Skywalker, Yoda's training of Luke Skywalkerm, or Grand Admiral Thrawn's training of Captain Pellaeon.

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Destiny Fulfilled
You gain a permanent destiny bonus equal to your proficiency bonus on checks made with one class skill of your choice.

### Liberation
Your destiny is to liberate a group, population, or region from Imperial domination. The focus of this destiny can range from a persecuted group - a small alien enclave, a remote town, or an orbital installation - all the way to a city, a starport, or even an entire planet. For instance, a hero might endeavour to free a planet's governing legislature, which has been previously relocated to a well-guarded penal camp by a hard-line Imperial governor to silence its dissenting view. As another example, they could attempt to wrest control of a starship construction facility from the Empire by influencing the worker population to revolt, supplying arms and equipment, and leading them in a mutiny. Achieving this objective usually requires organizing resistance to Imperial forces that are persecuting the local populace, destroying key installations or assets, or deterring or eliminating personnel that are vital for the Empire to maintain its oppressive grip.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
You gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.

### Redemption
Your destiny is to redeem a character that has been corrupted or otherwise turned to evil. Many Jedi seek to turn their fallen brethren away from the dark side. A Rebel agent might seek to turn his brother, an Imperial officer, away from the evil Empire, redeeming him back to the side of justice and freedom. The target of this destiny should be someone that has fallen from the light in some way, whether that means turning to the dark side of the Force or simply siding with evil over good. Turning someone away from their wicked ways is usually very difficult and requires far more than simple persuasion. Often a a character that fulfills this destiny does not survive it, and sometimes neither does their redeemed target. Aditionally, you may be your own target for this destiny, making your own redemption the means of fulfilling it.

Examples of this destiny include Luke Skywalker turning Darth Vader away from the dark side and Revan's redemption of Bastila Shan on the Star Forge.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
You receive a permanent 2 increase to your Wisdom score. In addition, the Corruption score of the redeemed character is reduced to 1 and they lose any dark side corruptions they have accrued.

### Rescue
Your destiny requires you to save a person from death or an object from destruction. Often characters with this destiny will not know which person or object they're meant to save, let alone when or how to do so. They simply must be in the right place at the right time. A hero might spend months travelling with his allies before fulfilling his destiny by saving one of their lives. Conversely, a Rebel agent might engage in years' worth of espionage on his home planet, only to find that his destiny is to save a local Imperial magistrate who betrays the Empire after having her life saved.

Examples of this destiny include Han Solo saving Luke Skywalker's life at the Battle of Yavin and Wicket the Ewok rescuing Leia from the scout troopers on Endor.

#### Destiny Fulfilled
Increase two ability score of your choice by 1 each.

## Death and Destiny
Achieving one's destiny may yield great benefits, but the path of destiny can be perilous. Many characters in the *Star Wars* saga perish attempting to fulfil their destinies. If a Force-sensitive character dies while fulfilling (or attempting to fulfil) their destiny, the GM may allow the dead character to manifest as a Force spirit. If a non-force-wielder perishes while pursuing or achieving his destiny, the GM may decide that the character's sacrifice or untimely death imparts some benefit upon his surviving allies.

**Force Spirit.** A force-wielder who dies in the process of fulfilling his destiny may manifest as a Force spirit. For a light side force-wielder, this means transforming into a translucent blue spirit that can appear before his former allies. For a dark side force-wielder, this means becoming an evil dark side spirit that can linger on, continuing to spread the influence of the dark side.

If a Force sensitive character dies while fulfilling their destiny, that character may become a Force spirit, retaining their consciousness (and their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores) but becoming completely incorporeal. The Force spirit can menifest at will and can vanish just as easily. It can also walk through walls and exist in the vacuum of space. Additionally, Force spirits can travel anywhere in the galaxy instantly with a mere thought. However, Force spirits have no substance and cannot interact physically with creatures or objects in the universe.

When a hero dies and becomes a Force spirit, that Force spirit might serves as a guide, advising heroes in times of dire need and sharing valuable information or wisdom it held in life.

**Noble Sacrifice.** Whenever a character willingly sacrifices himself for a noble cause, particularly while fulfilling his destiny he can bolster the resolve of his surviving comrades and allies. For example, when Arvel Crynyd crashed his A-wing into the bridge of the Executor, it was a turning point in the Battle of Endor. When a character dies fulfilling his destiny in such a way, all allies within the same star system gain one destiny point.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Vengeance.** When a valued ally falls in the pursuit of his destiny, it can have powerful effects on those present at the time of his death. When a character dies fulfilling his desting, any ally who witnesses his death may choose to become filled with a desire to avenge their fallen comrade, gaining a destiny point. Since revenge leads to the dark side, any force-wielder who chooses to gain this bonus must immediately increase his Corruption score by 1.<div class='footnote'>EXPANDED CONTENT | VARIANT RULES | DESTINY</div>

# Starship Destiny

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/SEqkLS8.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:38px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ometimes a starship is more than just a means<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of transportation. Sometimes, it's part of a character's destiny. In fact, for some characters, it's the focal point of their destiny, which might otherwise be nothing more than to wander aimlessly from one jam to another. No matter how humble (or downright ramschackle) a starship might appear, if it's the destiny of a character to be linked with that ship, it can accomplish amazing things.

If you decide to link a starship (or, rarely, a planetary vehicle) to your destiny, that replaces the normal destiny mechanic. In essence, you don't have a destiny to accomplish any specific goal; instead, you're destined have the most important events in your life with a specific starship. This option is appropriate in campaigns with at least a moderate frequency of starship-scale encounters, but it's certainly not restricted to such campaigns. In fact, if a campaign centers exclusively around starship-scale action, this option might be too powerful as it allows access to Destiny Points in most encounters. Only the GM can decide if starship-linked destinies are appropriate for a given campaign.

You earn and spend Destiny Points with a starship-linked destiny using the same basic rules as with the normal destiny options. However, having your destiny linked to a starship causes the rules to work slightly differently.

Firstly, Destiny Points are earned when you experience (and survive) key campaign events involving you and your starship.

Secondly, if a starship is your destiny, it is never completely destroyed. Even if it is blown up in battle or confiscated by Hutts before being crushed and melted, some small part of it survives. Perhaps you find the hyperspace core the whole starship was built around, or its ruined hull is found drifting as debris after that battle. Your starship can cease to be functional as easily as anyone else's, but a recognizable part of it always survives for you to rebuild (or retrofit to a similar starship). It can be as time consuming and difficult as getting a new starship would be (if not more so), but the result still qualifies as your destiny-linked starship.

Finally, the options you can exercise by using a Destiny Point are slightly different, as detailed below. The following are possible only when you are acting as a crew member (pilot, gunner, mechanic, operator or commander) on the starship linked to your destiny:

\columnbreak

- Cause an attack rolled against your starship to suffer disadvantage, or gain advantage on a saving throw against an attack on your starship, even once the attack is resolved. (Pilot or commander only.)
- Gain advantage on any pilot check. (Pilot only.)
- Allow your starship to act out of turn, thus changing your position in the initiative order. (Pilot, operator or commander only.)
- Gain advantage on an attack roll, or impose disadvantage on an enemy saving throw, against an attack from your ship's weapons. (Gunner or operator or commander only.)
- Repair your starship, restoring hit points by rolling a number of its hit die equal to or less than your level. (Mechanic only.)
- Immediately restore your starship's shields to full. (Mechanic or operator only.)
- Gain advantage on any skill check made to interact with the ship.
- Immediately gain 2 tactical dice.

In general, a character with a starship-linked destiny can do what no one else can manage - unless they, too, are linked to its destiny. There's nothing to prevent multiple characters from being destiny-linked to the same starship. Such characters might share the ship, or might constantly be stealing, buying or gambling it back and forther between them.

# Weapon Sundering

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/5CsIIIt.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:67px;width:37px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ou can attempt to damage, and potentially<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy, a weapon held by a hostile creature. On your turn, you can take the Sundering action to damage an enemy's weapon. Make a melee weapon attack roll with disadvantage against the target's Armor Class as normal. If the attack hits, roll weapon damage and instead apply the damage to one weapon being wielded by your target.

### Weapon Hit Dice and Hit Points
A weapon's hit points are presented both as Hit Dice and hit points. A weapon has a number of Hit Dice equal to twice its damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s. A weapon's hit points are determined by taking the average of its hit dice. For instance, a blaster has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s, so it has 9 hit points on average, as shown in the Hit Dice Average table below.

#### Hit Dice Average
|Hit Die|Average Hit Points per Hit Die|
|:--:|:--:|
|d4|2.5|
|d6|3.5|
|d8|4.5|
|d10|5.5|
|d12|6.5|

At the GM's discretion, some weapons might be resistant, immune, or even vulnerable to certain types of damage. Enhanced weapons are resistance, or even immune, to damage from unenhanced weapons.

### Repairing Damaged/Broken Weapons
A weapon is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. As long as a weapon has 1 or more hit points remaining, a character can attempt to perform minor repairs by spending one or more of the weapon's Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the weapon's maximum number of Hit Dice. To restore hit dice, the player must first make an Intelligence (Technology) check
If a weapon has at least 1 HP remaining, you can attempt to make minor repairs to it during a Short Rest. To attempt to restore HD, a character must make an Intelligence (Technology) roll. The DC is 8 + the amount of damage the weapon has taken. The player has advantage on the roll if they know the *mending* tech power or are proficient with the appropriate artisan's tools (armstech's tools for blasters and vibroweapons, artificer's tools for lightweapons). On a failure, the Hit Die is expended and no hit points are restored. On a success, the player can spend the weapon's Hit Dice to restore hit points. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A weapon regains Hit Dice when serviced by a professional with the appropriate artisan's tools, who can repair the weapon over a number of hours equal to the size of the weapon's damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it would take 8 hours to repair. This service costs half the value of the weapon.

\columnbreak

<br>

> In reality, lightweapons are probably more effective than vibroweapons when it comes to sundering weapons. For the sake of balance, they aren't. At the GM's discretion, weapons might be resistant to kinetic damage, or vulnerable to energy damage, to represent this effectiveness.

A player can choose to specialize their character with the following features.

## Fighting Style
Certain class features or feats offer your choice of Fighting Style. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following Fighting Style instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Sunder Fighting
You are skilled at striking in order to damage, and potentially destroy, your enemies’ weapons. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- You no longer have disadvantage on Sundering attack rolls.
- When a foe hits you with a Sundering attack, you can use your reaction to add a +5 to your armor class vs the triggering attack. If this causes the attack to miss, your weapon does not take any damage.

## Feat
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat’s description says otherwise. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following feat instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook.

### Sundering Mastery
You have mastered rending your foes’ weapons, leaving them impotent and vulnerable to your follow up attacks. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:
- Before you make a Sundering attack with weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.
- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a Sundering attack or reduce a weapon to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
