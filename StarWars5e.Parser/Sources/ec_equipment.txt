## Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Auto
Automatic weapons can only fire in burst mode.

#### Defensive
Once per round per weapon, before you make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the defensive property, you can choose to take a -1 penalty on the attack roll. If you do so, you gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

#### Disintegrate
When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

#### Shocking
When you hit a creature with a weapon with the shocking property, you can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described to below.

#### Bo-Rifle
The bo-rifle is a lasat weapon most commonly carried by the Honor Guard of Lasan, which has the unique property of functioning as both a rifle and a staff. As a bonus action, you can switch between each mode, detailed below. 

***Rifle.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

***Staff.*** While in this mode, the weapon gains the shocking property.

#### E-Web Blaster
Rather than traditional power cells, the E-Web Blaster uses specialized power generator that allow it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a battery pack takes an action.

The E-Web requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can
deploy or collapse the E-web on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.

#### Grenade Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

#### Interchangeable Weapons System
The IWS is a heavy weapon that can fire in three different modes. As a bonus action, you can switch between each mode, detailed below. Each mode contains and uses its own power source.

***Antiarmor.*** While in this mode, rather than traditional power cells, the IWS fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

***Blaster.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

***Sniper.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

#### Needler
The needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.

#### Rocket Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets.

#### Vapor Projector
The vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank's effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you're using as you fire it (no action required).

#### Vibroshield
A vibroshield does not fill the hand slot, but you can’t use a vibroshield while the hand is full. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength saving throws to avoid being disarmed.

The loaded weapon deals cold damage instead of energy, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 cold damage has its speed reduced by 5 feet until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed.

### Utilities

#### Basic Computer Spike
When you make an Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, you can use the spike (no action required) to reroll the check. You must use the new roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the spike, but you must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.

#### Gravity Generator
Gravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

### Weapon and Armor Accessories

#### Shock Gloves
