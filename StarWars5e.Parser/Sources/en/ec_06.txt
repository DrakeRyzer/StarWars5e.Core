## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

### Close Quarters Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced utilizing powers in close quarters, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When making a ranged force or tech attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.  
- Your ranged force and tech attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. 
- You learn one at-will power that requires an attack roll. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### Combat Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced making your powers more difficult to avoid, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When a creature rolls a 1 on the d20 roll of a saving throw against a power you cast that deals damage, they instead take the highest number possible for the damage die.
- You learn one at-will power that requires a saving throw. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### Dual Focused Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You have learned to bifurcate your attention while concentrating on powers, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- If you attempt to cast a power that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing power, you can maintain concentration on both powers simultaneously. You must spend your action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both powers.                              
- At the end of each of your turns where you have two powers you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you've been concentrating on two powers). On a failure, you lose concentration for both powers. You can drop concentration on one of your powers during your turn as a free action to avoid this saving throw.
- Any time you would be forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both powers' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both powers.

### Martial Adept
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:
- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have two superiority dice, which are d4s. These dice are used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

### Mounted Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You are trained in the use of powers while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:
- When you cast a power targeting yourself, you can also affect your mount with the power.
- You have advantage on melee force or tech attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Quick Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers in quick succession, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you may use your action to cast a power with a power level no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).
- When you cast a power with a casting time of a bonus action, you can cast it without expending force or tech points as long as it is no higher level than your proficiency bonus. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Sniping Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers more accurately from long range, learning techniques that give you the following benefits:
- When you cast a power that requires you to make an attack roll, the power's range is doubled.
- Your ranged force and tech attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- You learn one at-will power that requires an attack roll. Your casting ability for this at-will power depends on the power list you chose from: Wisdom or Charisma (depending on power alignment) for force powers or Intelligence for tech powers.

### War Caster
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
You've practiced casting powers in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a power when you take damage.
- Once per round, when a hostile creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a power at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The power must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

### Casting Specialist
_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast force or tech powers_<br>
Choose one from force- or tech-casting. You've mastered your chosen casting type, gaining the following benefits:
- You gain a +1 bonus to your force or tech save DC and your force or tech attack modifier.
- Once per turn, when you cast a power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can have advantage on one attack roll, or you can force one creature affected by the power to have advantage or disadvantage on the saving throw (your choice). Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest. Once you've used this feature on a creature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
- Once per turn, when you cast a power that doesn't require an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, but requires a die roll, you can choose the maximum or minimum on the die (your choice). If the power requires rolling multiple dice, you can only affect a number of them equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) in this way. Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest.

You can select this feat twice. Each time you do so, you must choose a different casting type.
