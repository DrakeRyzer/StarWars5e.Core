## What's Different?
While this expansion utilizes the base rules of 5th Edition, there are significant differences that will be illustrated here, broken down by chapter. There is more information in each chapter, as per the SRD.

### Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Characters
This chapter explains step-by-step character building, as exemplified by Han Solo.

### Chapter 2: Species
Races relabeled to species, all of which are brand new.

### Chapter 3: Classes
There are ten classes. Berserker, fighter, monk, and operative are similar to their 5e counterparts. Scout is a heavily modified ranger. Engineer is based off artificer, but extrapolated to be a full caster. Guardian is based off of paladin, and consular is based off of sorcerer, with changes to better fit a force-wielder. Sentinel is a reimagining of a bard, but as a 2/3 caster. Scholar is a brand new class.

### Chapter 4: Backgrounds
Backgrounds feature one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This helps players realize their characters in a more personal fashion.

### Chapter 5: Equipment
Currency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced items, with rarities designed to mimic those of **Star Wars: the Old Republic**. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than simply simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also utilizes a few houserules: light, medium, and heavy shields with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor, new weapon features, etc.

### Chapter 6: Customization Options
- New multiclassing requirements/proficiencies
- Spell point variant with different multiclassing
- Fighting styles have been completely changed, with paired fighting masteries
- Lots more feats

### Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
Generally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills. 

### Chapter 8: Adventuring
Minor changes to better fit the galaxy at large.

### Chapter 9: Combat
Lots of changes here: Two-Weapon Fighting with guns, Double-Weapon Fighting, damage type changes, and more.

### Chapter 10:<br> Force- and Tech-casting
There are several changes in this section:
- Spells are now called powers.
- Cantrips are now called at-will powers.
- My own interpretation and simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.
- Spellcasting has been separated into force- and tech-casting.<br> &emsp;Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force Points, which regenerate on a long rest.<br> &emsp;Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short rest.<br> &emsp;While a character can have both force- and tech-casting, they are kept completely separate.
- The number of known at-will powers and 1st-level and higher powers are no longer separate. 

### Chapters 11 and 12:<br> Force and Tech Powers
Chapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.

### Appendix A: Conditions
This appendix features most (all?) of the traditional 5e conditions, as well as a couple new ones of my own making.

### Appendix B:<br> Recommended Variant Rules
This appendix features a number of variant rules I recommend.

### Index
It's an index.
