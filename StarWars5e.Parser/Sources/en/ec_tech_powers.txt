#### Bestow Virus
_3rd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a droid, construct, or a creature with a tech focus, and it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or receive a tech-based curse for the duration of the power. When you cast this power, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target.

A *remove virus* power ends this effect. At the GM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect.

**Overcharge Tech.** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th-level tech slot, the power lasts until it is dispelled. Using a tech slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

#### Enhance Droid
_2nd-level tech power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch

- ***Motivator.*** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated.

#### Glide

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 30 feet of you falls

One willing creature gains the ability to glide when falling. For the duration of the power, it falls at a rate of 30 feet per round and can move up to 30 feet horizontally as well on each of its turns. If the creature lands before the power ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the power ends for that creature.

#### Short Circuit

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet

You electrocute a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage. If the target is a droid, construct, or has a tech focus, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. 

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Voltaic Shielding

- **Duration:** 1 hour 

A protective barrier surrounds you, manifesting as crackling lightning that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 lightning damage.
