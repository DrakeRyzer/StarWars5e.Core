&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he *Star Wars* 5th Edition roleplaying game is about</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vast worlds populated populated by myriad sites and species. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, SW5e is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the expansive marketplace and seeing the different people's living their lives, and seeing how they might interact with the player's characters.

This book is designed to add another significant layer to your SW5e experience. The rules are designed to work alongside the traditional SW5e ruleset, and so an experienced player should have no trouble jumping right into the book. For the less experienced-or more curious-player, this Introduction discusses the basics.

<div class='descriptive'>

<br>

**Game Master (GM):** As you enter the teeming marketplace, you see merchants of all types peddling wares, trying to entice the flowing traffic. As you move further into the crowd, one of the vendors catches your attention as they hail you.

**Drew (playing Dash):** I'm going to check out what they have for sale.

**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I'm going to keep an eye on the crowd to make sure our things aren't stolen.

Unlike a game of make-believe, SW5e gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to determine whether or not they can haggle for a better price, or to try to entice a merchant to accept work instead of credits for their goods. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Rickey, you're checking the vendor's goods?

**Rickey:** Yeah. Do I see anything cool?

**GM:** Make an Intelligence check.

**Rickey:** Does my Investigation skill apply?

**GM:** Sure!

**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Ugh. Seven.

**GM:** You see many trinkets and baubles but nothing catches your eye. And Drew, Dash is watching the crowd?

In the *Star Wars* <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might join a faction, earning renown to increase their standing. They might become benevolent Jedi, malevolent Sith, ruthless bounty hunters, or scurrying scoundrels. If no faction catches their attention, they might instead create their own.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe a populous city, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they spend time buying and selling wares? Or will they look for work and entertainment in the city to make—or spend—their coin?

Then the GM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, SW5e is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's rank in a faction, and the tier of the faction itself.

There's no winning and losing in the *Star Wars* <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, dispatched by a Sith lord. The party itself might meet its demise if it antagonizes a powerful and malicious faction. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the players might choose (or be forced) to create new characters to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## Explore Cities
One of the premier components of *Star Wars* 5th Edition, versus a traditional <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dungeons and Dragons</span> campaign, is the massive—almost overwhelming—number of planets. Each planet, and each city, hosts its own species, communities, factions, and traditions.

Each city hosts its own activities and factions. Players can choose to engage in these activities and join these factions if they so desire. Alternatively, players can instead form their own faction, recruiting other

\pagebreakNum

members to span across multiple cities, planets, or even the galaxy itself.

But if your players want to explore cities more indepth, this book is designed to those ends.

## Using This Book
*Wretched Hives* is divided into eight chapters.

**Chapters 1-4** are about spending time in cities, joining factions or creating your own, and how to run inter-faction conflict. It includes information on the major activities adventurers can engage in, as well as the boons they gain for joining a faction and maintaining a good standing. It also includes the rules for creating their own faction, if they so choose, with a step-by-step guide on how to build one. Lastly, it includes rules to help govern or inspire conflict between factions.

**Chapters 5-6** include new adventuring gear and customization options to help players realize their characters. It adds many new weapons and armor, including new properties, as well as all sorts of new adventuring gear, tools, and trade goods.

**Chapters 7-8** include the rules for enhanced items and tools, including how to implement them in your game and give tools more weight.

### Wretched Hives, Engineers, and You
Engineers have a lot of interaction and overlap with this book. These guidelines help exist to merge the overlap.

#### Crafting and Blueprints
If adopting this book with the intention of utilizing crafting, any class with proficiency in a tool should know a number of standard rarity blueprints no greater than half their character level, rounded up. Engineers should instead know a number equal to their level. Additionally, engineers can learn blueprints that exist as part of their archetype's modifications.

#### Armormech and Armstech
For armormech, armstech, and other similar archetypes that focus on modifying an item—specifically, armor, blasters, clothing, focus generators, lightweapons, shields, vibroweapons, or wristpads—use the following rules.

***Modifications.*** Some engineer modifications have a counterpart in this book. For instance, armstech's Burst Core modification exists in Appendix A, but Booming Strikes does not. Consequently, an engineer can craft a Burst Core that can be used by anyone using this book's crafting rules, but not Booming Strikes. The engineer must meet the archetype's level requirements for a modification before it can craft it using this book's crafting rules. If the modification presented in this book is different than that of the archetype feature, you should instead use this book's modification.

***Chassis.*** Engineer chassis can use *Wretched Hives* modifications of any rarity. These modifications do count towards their maximum modification slots, but do not reduce their maximum tech points. Additionally, an engineer's chassis is differently limited than normal item chassis. For instance, an armstech's blaster can

\columnbreak

 support one targeting and barrel, but any number of cores and attachments. Additionally, it can support up to three augments.

#### Astrotech
Like armormech and armstech, some astrotech modifications exist in this book, while others do not. For instance, Four-Armed Combatant exists in Appendix A, but Martial Protocol does not. Additionally, when installing *Wretched Hives* droid customizations in your droid companion, they count towards your maximum modification slots, but do not reduce your maximum tech points.

#### Other Archetypes
Some archetypes, such as Augmented Approach berserker, thematically use rules that exist in *Wretched Hives.* Their archetype features should not use the rules presented here.

## How to Play
Generally, the rules in this book use the same mechanics already encountered. The GM still describes the environment, and the players describe what they want to do. The GM then narrates the results of of the adventurers' actions.

### Game Dice
The game uses the same polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides, referenced in the same fashion; the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100. 

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Advantage and disadvantage function identically; with advantage, you roll two dice and take the higher value, while with the disadvantage you roll two dice and take the lesser.

### Specific Beats General
In the same vein, while some chapters contain broad strokes for the game's rules, others reference specific actions or activities that that override these rules, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: if a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

### Round Down
There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater, unless otherwise specified.

## What It Brings
*Wretched Hives* is designed to be an *in addition to* rather than *instead of*. If you implement some—or all—of these rules, however, you create more powerful adventuring parties. The rules included here add an additional level of customization to characters. All of the rules work in conjunction with each other, but are generally not interdependent; use as much or as little as you like.
