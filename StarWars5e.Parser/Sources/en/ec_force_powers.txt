#### Dun Moch
_1st-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to manipulate a creature into fighting you. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your demands. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this power doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

The power ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a power that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful power on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Force Blinding
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

You use the Force to emit a blinding flash of light from your hand. Roll 6d10, the total is how many hit points of creatures this power can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this power is blinded until the power ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the creature to be affected.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Force Concealment
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You shroud or alter the aura of a creature or object you touch so that Force powers reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature.

When you cast the power, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this power on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the effect lasts until it is dispelled.

***False Aura.*** You change the way the target appears to powers and Force-based enhanced effects, such as *sense force*, that detects the presence of the Force. You can make a Force-based unenhanced object or creature appear enhanced and to radiate a Force aura, or a Force-based enhanced object or creature appear unenhanced and to radiate no Force aura. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false aura apparent to any creature that handles the item.

***Cloak.*** You can change the way the target's affinity in the Force appears to the *force sight* power. For example, a Sith Lord with great power in the dark side of the Force can appear instead to have very little strength in the Force, with an affinity towards the light side.

#### Telekinetic Shield
_3rd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Animate Weapon
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You lift three piles of debris or small objects from the ground and interpose them between you and your opponents for the duration. 

While at least three piles remain, you have three-quarters cover. While two piles remain, you have half cover. While only one pile remains, you have one-quarter cover. The piles don't hinder your attacks. When you cast the power, or as an action on a subsequent turn, you can direct up to two piles to attack up to two creatures you can see within 30 feet. Make a ranged force attack roll for each pile. On a hit, a creature takes 2d6 kinetic plus 1d10 force damage. The pile is destroyed whether it hits or misses.

***Force Potency.*** If you cast this power with a force slot of 4th level or higher, the power creates one additional pile for each level above 3rd. 

#### Telemetry
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are.

If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what force powers, if any, are currently affecting it.

1st-level dark side power
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

A protective force surrounds you, manifesting as shimmering light that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 psychic damage.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You manifest a mantle of malevolent dark side energy to a radius of 15 feet. Each creature who enters this aura or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one or more creatures or objects not being worn or carried within 60 feet that weigh up to a combined total of 15 pounds.

If the creatures or objects collide with any one target during its travel, both the creatures or objects and the target take 3d8 kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d8 kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.
