## Enhanced Items Values
Enhanced item values should fall within a range, as shown below in the Enhanced Item Value by Rarity table. Consumables and item modifications should be about half the value of a permanent item.

Each item comes with a value. This is a suggested value; it might be higher or lower at any table, given the availability of enhanced items. 

> Certain items, such as weapon +1, have a multiplier instead of a value. You multiply this by the item's base price to determine the enhanced item's value. Occasionally, this might end with a result that falls outside the range of values for that rarity. Nonetheless, it should retain that value and rarity.

##### Enhanced Item Value by Rarity
|Rarity|Value|
|:--:|:--:|
|Standard|up to 1,000 cr|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|1,001 to 5,000 cr|

|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|100,001 - 500,000 cr|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|at least 500,001 cr|

You gain proficiency in all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and the Piloting skill. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check to recall or discern information about a weapon, piece of armor, or a military vehicle that this library contains information on, you are considered proficient in the check. 

**Side Effect:** This aggressively effective library can make it difficult to focus in stressful situations. You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. Additionally, you have disadvantage on ability checks while concentrating on a power.

This metal jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can open the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

_Prerequisite: Constitution 15_<br>

**Value:** 36,000 cr

_This clear plasti-polymer implant has an appearance vaguely resembling a multi-limbed cephalopod, and must be carefully installed by a master cybertech. It attaches by wrapping around the medulla, and produces a variety of combat adrenals for its user's consumption. It also performs blood-cleansing work to reduce the liver damage (for species that have a liver) caused by long-term adrenal use._

Once on your turn, you can activate this implant to gain the effects of an adrenal (no action required). This effect lasts for one minute, or until a different adrenal is chosen. You can choose from the following types of adrenals: 
- **Strength Adrenal:** You gain a +1 bonus to the damage rolls of melee weapon attacks, and you count as one size larger for the purpose of determining max carrying capacity and push, drag, and lift weight.
