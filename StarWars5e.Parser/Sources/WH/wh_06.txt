# Chapter 6: Customization Options

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he combination of ability scores, species, class, and</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability s cores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

#### Class Weapon Proficiencies
Certain classes—berserker, consular, engineer, fighter, guardian, and scout—have proficiency in all of a type of weapon. For instance, fighters are proficient in all blasters and all vibroweapons. Consequently, fighters have proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons present in Chapter 5. Other classes—monks, operatives, scholars, and sentinels—have proficiency in a certain set of weapons. For each of these classes, they gain proficiency in only certain weapons, as shown below in the Weapon Proficiencies by Class table:

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

The feats presented in this chapter should be considered valid options for background feats.

### Savage Shorty
*Prerequisite: Strength 13, size Small*<br>
Despite being short of stature, your size has no impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your speed increases by 5 feet.
- You lose the Undersized special trait.

### Force Guidance
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast force powers*<br>
You've learned to utilize your gift with the Force in a specific, unique way. You gain the following benefits
- Increase your Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

When you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded down, minimum of one) to the check if it doesn't already include that modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different skill or tool.

### Augmented Cyborg
You've experimented with cybernetic augmentations, granting the following benefits: 
- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
