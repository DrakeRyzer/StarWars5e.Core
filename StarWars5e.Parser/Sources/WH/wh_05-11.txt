# Chapter 5: Enhanced Items

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he ability to plunder enhanced items from the hoards</span><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of conquered pirates, or discover them in long-lost Sith tombs is an experience players expect. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.

### Rarity
Each enhanced item has a rarity: standard, premium, prototype, advanced, legendary, or artifact. Standard enhanced items, such as a medpac, are the most plentiful. Some legendary items, such as a Baragwin Stealth Unit, are more rare. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars or mishaps. Even premium items can't be easily created. Thus, many enhanced items are unique and well-preserved relics.

Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other enhanced items. Each rarity corresponds to a character level, as shown below in the Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification table. A character doesn't typically find a prototype enhanced item, for instance, until 5th-level or later. That said, rarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. If you want the darksaber to fall into the hands of 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.

##### Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification
|Rarity|Character Level|Identification DC|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font>|1st or higher|10|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|1st or higher|15|
|<font style="color:blue">Prototype</font>|5th or higher|20|
|<font style="color:purple">Advanced</font>|9th or higher|25|
|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|13th or higher|30|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|17th or higher|35|

If your campaign allows for trade in enhanced items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the GM, you determine the value of an individual enhanced item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Enhanced Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable, such as a medpac or stimpac, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the same rarity.

### Identifying Enhanced Items
Some enhanced items have properties not readily distinguishable to the naked eye. Identifying such an item requires use of the *analyze* tech power or inspection with the appropriate tools.

If a player is proficient in the appropriate type of tools (e.g. armstech's tools for a blaster or vibroweapon), they can make a check with them to identify the properties of an enhanced item over the course of a short rest. To use this benefit, you must have the tools, and the enhanced item must be within reach. The DC is found above in the Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification table.

\columnbreak

#### Variant: Simpler Identification
If you prefer enhanced items to be more readily identifiable, you can allow characters to identify enhanced items through experimentation. Over the course of a short rest, a character can focus on one enhanced item while being in physical contact with it. At the end of the short rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. 

### Attunement
Some enhanced items require a creature to form a bond with them before their enhanced properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its unenhanced benefits. For example, an enhanced heavy shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal heavy shield  to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its enhanced properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a holocron), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any enhanced properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three enhanced items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must ends it attunement to an item first. 

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest with the item, unless the item is cursed.

### Cursed Items
Some enhanced items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. An enhanced item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, such as the *analyze* tech power, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the curse's effects are revealed. 

Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first.

\pagebreak

## Enhanced Item Categories
Enhanced items fall into different categories depending on the type of enhanced item. Some categories, such as weapons and armor, are obvious. Others are less so.

### Adventuring Gear
Items that don't fall in one of the other categories are considered adventuring gear. They might be worn items, such as boots or a jetpack, or hand-held item like a holocron. This category is a catch-all for for items that don't fit in other categories. 

### Armor
Unless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its enhanced properties to function.

Some suits of enhanced armor specify the type of armor they are, such as durasteel armor or combat suit, or the category in which they fall, such as light or heavy armor. If an enhanced armor doesn't specific its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

### Consumables
Consumables are sub-categorized by their type: adrenals, explosives, medpacs, and stimpacs.

***Adrenals.*** Adrenals are designed to give a short term boost to a creature, like increased speed. Adrenal effects rarely last longer than a minute.

***Ammunition.*** Ammunition is unique sources of power for weapons. 

***Barriers.*** Barriers offer temporary protection, usually to a single damage type, and rarely last longer than a minute.

***Explosives.*** Explosives, such as cryo grenades or thermal detonators, are designed to cause an effect in a radius that varies depending on their nature. 

***Medpacs.*** Medpacs are used to restore hit points to creatures other than droids and constructs.

***Poisons.*** Poisons are used to incapacitate or harm beasts and humanoids.

***Stimpacs.*** Stimpacs offer boosts to creatures, like increasing an ability score, that typically last for an hour or more.

Typically, consumables are single use (unless the description says otherwise). Once a consumable is used, it takes effect immediately and is used up.

The value of consumables, due to their impermanent nature, is typically half that of permanent enhanced items.

### Cybernetic Augmentations
Cybernetic augmentations are enhancements built in to biological creatures, such as beasts or humanoids. They come in the form of replacements, which replace a physical body part, or enhancements, which simply augment a creature. Cybernetic augmentations are discussed further in Chapter 7: Cybernetic Augmentations.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Droid Customizations
Droid customizations are items that can enhance a droid in some way. They come in the form of parts, which replace a physical droid part, or protocols, which enhance the droid's functions in some way. Droid customizations are discussed further in Chapter 8: Droid Customizations.

### Focuses
Focuses are sub-categorized depending on what type of casting they augment: force or tech. 

***Force.*** Force focuses are used to augment the casting of force powers. The most common type of force focuses are focus generators, which are held in the hand of the forcecaster. Force focuses are not required to cast force powers.

***Tech.*** Tech focuses are used to augment the casting of tech powers. The most common type of tech focuses are wristpads, which are worn on the forearm of the techcaster. Unlike force focuses, tech focuses are required to cast tech powers.

A character can only benefit from one focus at a time. Once per round you can switch which focus you are benefiting from (no action required).

### Item Modifications
Some enhanced items come with vacant slots for item modifications, which improve the enhanced item in some way. Typically, though not always, enhanced items have either built in properties or vacant modification slots, but not both. Item modifications are discussed further in Chapter 6: Modifiable Items.

### Shields
Like armor, unless the description says otherwise, the shield must be actively wielded for its enhanced properties to function.

Some shields specify the category in which they fall, such as light shield generator or heavy shield. If an enhanced shield doesn't specify its category, you may choose the category or determine it randomly.

### Valuables
The majority of valuables—art, jewels, and sculptures—are scarce, highly sought after items of immense worth. Some valuables, in the form of relics, occasionally offer hidden secrets.

### Weapons
Whether crafted for a nefarious or benevolent purpose, weapons are among the most coveted of enhanced items.

Some enhanced items specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a lightsaber or assault cannon, or the category in which they fall, such as vibroweapon or blaster.  If an enhanced weapon doesn't specific its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.

## Awarding Enhanced Items
Enhanced items are prized by adventurers are all sorts, often serving as the main reward for an adventurer. This section helps determine which enhanced items end up in the characters' possession.

### Distribution 
The Minor and Major Enhanced Items by Rarity tables below show the number of enhanced items a party of four should encour during a campaign, culminating in 100 enhanced items accumulated by 20th level. The tables show much many of those items are meant to be handed out during the five tiers of play. The second and third tiers (levels 5-8 and 9-12, respectively) are intended to be when characters receive the majority of enhanced items, since these are the tiers where the majority of campaigns occur.

#### Minor and Major Items
The most common distinction between minor and major enhanced items is attunement. All items that require attunement should be treated as major enhanced items. On the other hand, all consumables and item modifications should be treated as minor enhanced items. Many items, however, do not easily fall into those two categories. Generally, if the item has a significant impact on one of the three pillars of adventure—exploration, social interaction, or combat—but does not require attunement, it should nonetheless be treated as a major item.

For instance, armor +1 does not require attunement, but it has a significant impact in combat, so it should be treated as major. Mag-lock boots, however, don't significantly impact any aspect of gameplay, and thus should be treated as minor.

<br><br><br><br>

<br><div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

### Choosing Items Level by Level
You decide when to place an item in an adventure that you're creating or modifying usually because you think the story calls for an enhanced item, the characters need one, or the players would be especially pleased to get one.

When you want to select an item as treasure for an encounter, the Minor and Major Enhanced Items by Rarity tables serve as your item budget, as follows:

___

- **1.** Jot down a copy of the table in your notes, so that you can make adjustments to the numbers as you select items to be placed in an adventure.
- **2.** Refer to the line in the Character Level column that corresponds to the level of the player characters in your game. The entries in that row of the table indicate the total number of items that would be appropriate for the characters to receive by the end of the tier represented by that row.
- **3.** Choose an enhanced item of any rarity for which the entry in this row is not 0.
- **4.** When the characters obtain an item, modify your notes to indicate which part of your budget this expenditure came from by subtracting 1 from the appropriate entry in the table.

___

In the future, if you choose an item of a rarity that's not available in the current tier but is still available in a lower tier, deduct the item from the lower tier. If all lower tiers also have no items available of a given rarity, deduct the item from a higher tier.

# Chapter 6: Modifiable Items

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he ability to modify your equipment, in the same way</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you do your starship, adds a degree of ownership that surpasses the simple acquisition of an item. If your players want the ability to micromanage their gear, consider allowing the following rules.

## Modifying Equipment
Modifying an item requires three key components: a modifiable item chassis, a modification to install, and the appropriate tools. An item can only be modified by someone proficient with appropriate tools, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page \_\_\_.

### Modifiable Item Chassis
Every item chassis comes with at least four modification slots, increasing to six at higher rarities, as determined by the chassis's rarity, as shown below in the Modification Slots by Rarity table.

##### Modification Slots by Rarity
|Rarity|Modification Slots|
|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font>|4|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|4|
|<font style="color:blue">Prototype</font>|5|
|<font style="color:purple">Advanced</font>|5|
|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|6|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|6|

Every modifiable item chassis shares the same four slots, determined by their type, as shown in the Available Modification Slots table below. Prototype and advanced modifiable item chassis also have one augment slot, in addition to the four base slots for their type, while legendary and artifact modifiable item chassis have two augment slots.

A modifiable item chassis can only include modifications of the same rarity or a lesser rarity. For instance, if you have a prototype modifiable item chassis, you can modify it with standard, premium,<br> and prototype<br> modifications.<br> However, the<br> item's nature<br> does not<br> allow it to support high rarity modifications.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Installing Modifications
Installing a modification takes one hour and requires an ability check with the required tool, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page \_\_\_. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the modification being installed, as shown below in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

##### Installation and Removal DC by Rarity
|Rarity|Installation and Removal DC|
|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font>|5|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|10|
|<font style="color:blue">Prototype</font>|15|
|<font style="color:purple">Advanced</font>|20|
|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|25|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|30|

On a success, the modification is correctly installed. On a failure, the modification is not installed, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.

### Removing Modifications
Removing a modification requires an ability check with the required tool, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the modification being removed, as shown above in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

On a success, the modification is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the modification is removed but destroyed.

### Modifications by Item Type
The modifications available varies for each individual item type. For instance, a blaster always has four modification slots—targeting, barrel, energy core, and matrix—and up to two augment slots, determined by its rarity. Augments are universal across all modifiable<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;items, while targeting, barrel,<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;energy core, and matrix<br>  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;are unique to blasters.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:28px'></div>

### Color Crystals
In addition to the modifications unique to themselves, all lightweapons come with a slot for a color crystal. Typically, newly created lightweapons come with one of the more common color variants, such as green, blue, or red. Occasionally, a character might come across a more scarce color crystal. When determining what color crystal a lightweapon comes with, the GM can choose for the player, or have the player make a universal forcecasting ability check. The result of the check affects the color of the crystal, as shown below in the Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier table.

##### Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier
|Forcecasting<br> Ability Check DC|d100 Roll<br>Item modifier|
|:--:|:--:|
| 1|-15|
| 5|-10|
|10| -5|
|15|  0|
|20| +5|
|25|+10|
|30|+20|

> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Color Crystal table, which is discussed below.

Once a player has made their forcecasting ability check to discover a lightweapon color crystal, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Color Crystal table below, applying a modifier based on the result of their forcecasting ability check.

##### Color Crystal

<div style='column-count:2'>

|d100|Crystal Color|
|:--:|:--:|
| 1-20|Blue|
|21-40|Red|
|41-60|Green|
|61-70|Yellow|
|71-80|Purple|
|81-90|Orange|

|d100|Crystal Color|
|:--:|:--:|
|91-93|Viridian|
|94-96|Cyan|
|   97|Bronze|
|   98|Silver|
|   99|White|
|  100|Black|

</div>

> This table includes the most common and desirable color crystals. More extensive options can be awarded at the discretion of the GM.

A player can choose the color crystal that is the result of their percentile dice rolled, or they can choose one that falls below it. For instance, if the player rolls a 91 and finds a viridian color crystal, they could instead choose a yellow color crystal, as if they had rolled a 63.

**Value:** 9,000 cr

When you spend tech points and deal damage with a tech power cast through this wristpad, you deal additional damage equal to the number of tech points spent.

### Storage
Storage modifications typically offer a unique feature to wristpads, such as increasing the efficacy of tech powers. For instance:

#### Bansche Purifier MENAD Pro Mark I
_<font style="color:green">Item modification (storage), premium</font>_

**Value:** 1,600 cr

When you cast a tech power with this wristpad that gives you a bonus to AC or saving throws, you can increase that bonus by +1.

### Sample Item
When generating this sample wristpad, I elected to create a standard, which would have four modification slots.

#### Basic Wristpad
_<font style="color:#4a5568">Focus (tech), standard (requires attunement)</font>_

**Value:** 800 cr

This wristpad has modification slots appropriate for processor, motherboard, dataport, and storage modifications. This wristpad can only support modifications of standard rarity.

## Armor and Shields
Unlike other item types, armor and shields share three of their modification slots, while one is unique.

### Overlay
Overlay modifications typically augment armor and shield's bonus to AC. For instance:

#### Bonded Plates Mark I
_<font style="color:blue">Item modification (overlay), prototype</font>_

**Value:** 8,000 cr

You gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Underlay
Underlay modifications typically augment armor and shield's bonus to saving throws. For instance:

#### Strengthening Underlay Mark I
_<font style="color:green">Item modification (underlay), premium</font>_

**Value:** 1,750 cr

You gain a +1 bonus to Strength and Constitution saving throws.

### Reinforcement  
Reinforcement modifications typically offer a unique feature to armor and shields, such as increasing hit points. For instance:

#### Bioenhancement Matrix Mark II
_<font style="color:purple">Item modification (reinforcement), advanced</font>_

**Value:** 38,000 cr

Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level, and it increases by 2 every time you gain a level. 

### Armoring and Shielding
Armoring and shielding modifications typically offer a unique feature to armor and shields, respectively, such as a situation bonus to AC. For instance:

#### Horizontal Exojets
_<font style="color:green">Item modification (armoring), premium</font>_

**Value:** 1,600 cr

Whenever you take the Dodge or Dash actions, your base walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

#### Cortosis Microweave Gilding
_<font style="color:blue">Item modification (shielding), prototype</font>_

**Value:** 10,000 cr

You gain a +1 bonus to AC against melee attacks.

### Sample Item
When generating this sample armor, I elected to create a premium combat suit, which would have four modification slots. This armor can only support modifications of standard and premium rarity.

#### Fine Combat Suit
_<font style="color:green">Armor (combat suit), premium (requires attunement)</font>_

**Value:** 4,200 cr

This armor has modification slots appropriate for overlay, underlay, reinforcement, and armoring modifications.

\columnbreak

## Augments
Augments are intended to offer features universal across items, such as an increase to an ability score or augmenting a class feature. For instance:

#### Basic Constitution Augment
_<font style="color:green">Item modification (augment), premium</font>_

**Value:** 2,000 cr

Your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Berserker Offensive Augment
_<font style="color:blue">Item modification (augment), prototype</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: at least 1 level in berserker_

**Value:** 8,500 cr

Your Rage damage bonus increases by 1, and when you score a critical hit, you can roll one additional weapon damage die and add the result to the total.

#### Exceptional Intelligence Augment
_<font style="color:#dd6b20">Item modification (augment), legendary</font>_

**Value:** 225,000 cr

Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your maximum for this score increases by 1.

#### Improved Strength Augment
_<font style="color:blue">Item modification (augment), prototype</font>_

**Value:** 12,000 cr

Your Strength score increases by 2.

#### Master Charisma Augment
_<font style="color:red">Item modification (augment), artifact</font>_

**Value:** 47,500 cr

#### Optimized Materials Augment
_<font style="color:green">Item modification (augment), premium</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: An item with the_ strength _property_

**Value:** 1,500 cr

The Strength requirement for this item is removed. 

#### Superior Wisdom Augment
_<font style="color:purple">Item modification (augment), advanced</font>_

**Value:** 47,500 cr

Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your maximum for this score increases by 1.

### Installing Augments in Other Items
Additionally, a character proficient in tinker's tools can install augments in items of prototype or higher rarity. First, the character must spend one uninterrupted hour tinkering with the item, which can be done over a short rest, with their tinker's tools. The character must then make an ability check with tinker's tools. On a result of less than 20, the item gains no augment slots, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. On a result of 20 or higher, the item gains one vacant augment slot. On a result of 30 or higher, the item gains two augment slots. Adding augment slots to an item causes that item to require attunement, if it didn't already. Prototype and advanced items can only support one augment slot, while legendary and artifact items can support up to two.

# Chapter 7: Cybernetic Augmentations

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he ability to augment yourself with cybernetics, in the</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same way you modify your items or starship, adds an additional layer of customization to any character. If players want access to cybernetic enhancements beyond those offered by certain archetypes, consider allowing the following rules.

## Augmenting Creatures
Augmenting a creature with cybernetic enhancements requires three key components: a valid target for the augmentation, an augmentation to install, and biotech's tools. A creature can only be modified by someone with proficiency in biotech's tools.

### Valid Targets
Typically, only beasts and humanoids are valid targets for augmentations. A creature can support a number of cybernetic augmentations equal to their proficiency bonus.

### Augmentation Time
It takes 8 hours to install an augmentation in a Medium creature. The time it takes to install an augmentation in a creature of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown below in the Creature Size Time Modifier table below.

##### Creature Size Time Modifier
| Creature Size | Time Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.25 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 5 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |

For instance, to install an augmentation in a Medium creature takes 8 hours. To install an augmentation in a Huge creature, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).

The installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC. 

### Side Effects
In addition to the side effects associated with each augmentation, your body undergoes changes, depending on how many augmentations you adopt, as shown below in the Cybernetic Augmentation Side Effects table.

##### Cybernetic Augmentation Side Effects
|Number of<br> Augmentations&nbsp;|Side Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|2|You have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal ion damage.|
|4|You have vulnerability to ion damage.|
|6|You count as a droid for powers that affect only droids or constructs.|

\columnbreak

### Installing Augmentations
In addition to the time and cost requirement, installing an augmentation requires an ability check with biotech's tools. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the augmentation being installed, as shown below in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

##### Installation and Removal DC by Rarity
|Rarity|Installation and Removal DC|
|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font>|5|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|10|
|<font style="color:blue">Prototype</font>|15|
|<font style="color:purple">Advanced</font>|20|
|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|25|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|30|

On a success, the augmentation is correctly installed. On a failure, the augmentation is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. Additionally, on a failure, the recipient suffers another effect, depending on the type of augmentation installed:
- **Enhancement:** On a failure, the recipient suffers one level of exhaustion.
- **Replacement:** On a failure, the recipient loses the ability to use the part being replaced for a period of time equal to the time it would take to install the replacement. For instance, to install an arm replacement in a Huge creature it takes 40 hours, performed over five days. If, at the end of the five day period, the installer fails the ability check with biotech's tools, the Huge creature loses the ability to use that arm for five days. 

### Removing Augmentations
Removing an augmentation takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with biotech's tools. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the augmentation being removed, as shown above in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

On a success, the augmentation is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the augmentation is removed but destroyed.

Additionally, if removing a replacement augmentation, the recipient loses the ability to use the missing part until it receives another suitable replacement.

### Augmentation Categories
Two major categories of cybernetic augmentations exist in the galaxy: enhancements and<br> replacements.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/R9GT3Mg.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:5px;right:0px;width:420px;z-index:1000;' />

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 7 | CYBERNETIC AUGMENTATIONS</div>

\pagebreak

## Enhancements
Enhancements bestowed new abilities or improved the recipient in some fashion. Enhancements included skeletal reinforcement, subcutaneous communications hardware, and weapon mounts. Some enhancements have visible external components, while others were hidden beneath the skin. Enhancements put more of a drain on the body's resources, and recipients frequently suffered debilitating physical or mental side effects. For instance:

#### Active Camouflage Core
_<font style="color:purple">Cybernetic augmentation (enhancement), advanced</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Constitution 13_<br>

**Value:** 40,000 cr

_This internal augmentation can be activated to project a distortion field that bends visual light._

As an action, you can activate this augmentation to cast the _infiltrate_ tech power targeting yourself. Intelligence is your tech casting ability for this power, and if you cast it using this augmentation, it does not require concentration. 

**Side-effect:** While this augmentation is active, your speed is reduced by 10. Additionally, it fails to activate if you are submerged in water or other liquids.

#### Hidden Arm Blaster
_<font style="color:#4a5568">Cybernetic augmentation (enhancement), standard</font>_

**Value:** 775 cr

_This augmentation hides a weapon in its wearer's forearm that is almost completely undetectable by modern sensors._

This implant includes a small hidden blaster that is completely shielded and hidden from unenhanced investigation. You cannot use this hidden blaster until it is revealed. As a bonus action, you can reveal this weapon and make a single ranged weapon attack with it. You have proficiency with this weapon for this attack. It deals 1d4 energy damage on a hit, has a range of 20/60, and the light and reload 4 properties.

**Side Effect:** Reloading this weapon takes longer than usual. You can reload and re-conceal this weapon over one hour, which can be done during a short rest. This hidden compartment can only fit the specific blaster with which it is paired.

#### Integrated Subdermal Armor
_<font style="color:green">Cybernetic augmentation (enhancement), premium</font>_<br>

**Value:** 1750 cr

_This implant reinforces your skin with an ablative woven alloy, making you difficult to damage._ 

When you aren't wearing armor, your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier. 

**Side Effect:** Each time you take damage while you aren't wearing armor, your speed decreases by 5 feet until the start of your next turn.

\columnbreak

## Replacements
Replacements are prosthetic or artificial units intended to replace limbs and damaged organs. Common replacements provided no benefits other than duplicating the essential functions of their biological counterparts, and they presented little strain on the beneficiary's overall well-being. In appearance, a cybernetic replacement could be recognizably artificial or virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. For instance:

#### Czerka Variable Claw-Hand Multitool
_<font style="color:blue">Cybernetic augmentation (replacement), prototype</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Intelligence 13_<br>

**Value:** 7,500 cr

This augmentation replaces a hand.

_The CVCM hand replacement appears to be a simple claw, but it contains a startling variety of tools, transforming to become whatever gadget is needed at the moment._ 

As a bonus action, you can transform this claw-hand into one of the following items of your choice, or back its default claw-hand state. While your claw-hand is transformed, you are considered to be proficient in the item it is replicating, if you are not already: 
 - Security kit
 - Artisan tools (one set, chosen at the time this augmentation is installed)
 - Commlink
 - Fusion cutter
 - Grappling hook (with 50 feet of fibercord cable)
 - Hydrospanner
 - Medkit
 - Repair kit
 - Hidden blade _(martial vibroweapon)_
 - Hold out _(simple blaster)_
 - Medium shield generator _(medium armor)_

For items that have charges such as the repair kit, you regain all expended charges at the end of a long rest. For items that use power cells, you can reload those with power cells normally.  

**Side Effect:** Once this hand replacement has been installed, you can no longer wield weapons in this hand other than those this augmentation can transform into. 

#### High-grade Cybernetic Legs
_<font style="color:blue">Cybernetic augmentation (replacement), prototype</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Constitution 13_

**Value:** 10,000 cr

This augmentation replaces a leg.

_This mechanical leg replacement increases speed and jumping height._

You gain advantage on Strength ability checks and Strength saving throws, you can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet, and your speed increases by 10 feet.  

**Side Effect:** Your powerful legs have difficulty moving quietly. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.

# Chapter 8: Droid Customizations

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">he ability to customize your droid companion with</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equipment tailored to them, in the same way you modify your items or starship, adds an additional layer of customization to any character or companion. If players want access to droid-specific equipment, consider allowing the following rules.

## Customizing Droids
Customizing a droid with droid-specific equipment requires three key components: a droid with a valid slot for the equipment, a piece of equipment to install, and astrotech's tools. A droid can only be customized by someone with proficiency in astrotech's tools.

### Valid Targets
Only droids are valid targets for droid customizations. A droid's motor can support two droid customizations, and can be upgraded to support up to six customizations. 

### Customization Time
It takes 8 hours to install a customization in a Medium droid. The time it takes to install a customization in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table below.

##### Droid Size Time Modifier
| Droid Size | Time Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.25 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 5 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |

For instance, to install a customization in a Medium droid takes 8 hours. To install an augmentation in a Huge droid, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).

The installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC. 

### Motor Upgrading
A droid's motor can be upgraded to support more customizations, up to a maximum of six customizations. To upgrade the motor in a Medium droid, it takes 8 hours and a number of credits depending on the total number of slots the upgraded motor grants, as shown below  in the Total Slots Upgrade Cost table.

\columnbreak

##### Total Slots Upgrade Cost
|Total Slots|Upgrade Cost&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|:--:|--:|
|3| 2,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|4| 10,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|5| 50,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|6| 200,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

The time and cost it takes to upgrade a motor in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table.

For instance, to upgrade a Medium droid's motor from 2 slots to 3 slots, it takes 8 hours and 2,000 cr. To upgrade a Huge droid's motor from 3 slots to 4 slots, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8) and 50,000 cr (5 x 10,000).

The installer works 8 hours a day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC.

### Installing Customizations
In addition to the time and cost requirement, installing a customization requires an ability check with astrotech's tools. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being installed, as shown below in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

##### Installation and Removal DC by Rarity
|Rarity|Installation and Removal DC|
|:--:|:--:|
|<font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font>|5|
|<font style="color:green">Premium</font>|10|
|<font style="color:blue">Prototype</font>|15|
|<font style="color:purple">Advanced</font>|20|
|<font style="color:#dd6b20">Legendary</font>|25|
|<font style="color:red">Artifact</font>|30|

On a success, the customization is correctly installed. On a failure, the customization is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. 

### Removing Customizations
Removing a customization takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with astrotech's tools. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being removed, as shown above in the Installation and Removal DC by Rarity table.

On a success, the customization is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the customization is removed but destroyed.

### Customization Categories
Two major categories of droid customizations exist in the galaxy: parts and protocols. 

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 8 | DROID CUSTOMIZATIONS</div>

\pagebreak

## Parts
Parts typically enhance or replace the features of a droid. Additional arms, integrated shield generators or weapons, or built-in repulsor lifts. For instance:

#### Combat Projector 
_<font style="color:green">Droid customization (part), premium</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Class IV droid_<br>

**Value:** 1,900 cr

_This little nozzle and fuel tank package are frequently located on a combat droid's wrist or abdomen, and can be configured to project flaming ionized gas or molton carbonite._

You have a small integrated projector in which you can load a flame projector canistor or carbonite canistor as a bonus action. If you store one of these canistors in this projector, you can attack with it normally and the damage it deals increases by 1d6 (of the same type that the canistor normally deals). This extra damage increases as your character level increases, to 2d6 at 11th level, and 3d6 at 17th level. 

#### Shock Arm
_<font style="color:green">Droid customization (part), premium</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Class II droid_

**Value:** 7,600 cr

_This small robotic appendage has a fork-like prod from that can release a substantial electrical discharge._

You have a small integrated droid shock arm with which you can make unarmed strikes. You have proficiency in this shock arm, which is a melee weapon with the _reach_ property and deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. You can use your choice of Strength or Intelligence for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. 

### Maximum Parts
A droid is limited in the number of part customizations they can have by their size, as shown below in the Droid Size Maximum Parts table.

##### Droid Size Maximum Parts
| Droid Size | Maximum Parts |
|:----:|:--:|
| Tiny  |1|
| Small |2|
| Medium |3|
| Large |4|
| Huge |5|
| Gargantuan |6|

The number of parts a droid has can not exceed the number of total customization slots granted by their motor. For instance, a Medium droid whose motor grants 4 slots can have a maximum of 3 parts. A Huge droid whose motor grants 5 slots, however, could fill all of those slots with parts.

\columnbreak

## Protocols
Protocols bestow new abilities or improvements on the target droid. Typically, they take the shape of systems improvements and offer no visible indicator that they exist. For instance:

#### Blaster Integration Protocol
_<font style="color:#4a5568">Droid customization (protocol), standard</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Class II droid_

**Value:** 700 cr

_Simple software package includes a basic suite of targeting and firing protocols that allow a Class II droid to integrate a modern blaster._

You can now integrate a single simple or martial blaster into your droid chassis. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can insert and integrate this blaster into your frame. As a bonus action, you can open or close a small hatch located somewhere on your droid body, permitting you to wield and fire the weapon normally when you want to attack with it. While the hatch is open, your hands are not considered occupied by this blaster. All other rules and conditions apply normally as if you were wielding this blaster in either one or two hands (your choice). 

#### Heavy Armor Integration Protocol
_<font style="color:green">Droid customization (protocol), premium</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Proficiency with light and medium armor_

**Value:** 2,800 cr

_This is gyro rebalancing and actuator tuning software designed to enable a droid to integrate and wield heavy armor._

You gain proficiency in heavy armor. 

#### Uncanniness Motivator
_<font style="color:blue">Droid customization (protocol), prototype</font>_<br>
_Prerequisite: Class III droid_

**Value:** 11,750 cr

_This software and sensor upgrade gives you a something of a knack for dealing with humanoids and other species that would otherwise find themselves disturbed by the artificiality of human-cyborg relations. Some droids are even programmed to use this suite to analyze and maximize the effect of this discord._

You gain a special pool of d6s that you can use to affect your negotiations with humanoids. When you make a damage roll, contested ability check, or roll dice to restore hit points to a creature, you can roll one of these d6s and add the result to your total for that creature. The creature must be a humanoid or beast, and must be able to hear and understand you to be affected by this die. You have a number of d6s equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended dice at the end of a long rest. 

### Maximum Protocols
A droid can have a number of protocol customizations up to the maximum allowed by their motor.

# Chapter 9: Tool Proficiencies

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:29px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps">ool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character's background and talents. At the game table, though, the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of skills, and it can be unclear how to use them together in certain situations. This section offers various ways that tools can be used in the game.

To make tool proficiencies more attractive choices for the characters, you can use the methods outlined below.

#### Advantage
If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up tool proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.

#### Added Benefit
Additionally, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with mason's tools makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.

## Tool Descriptions
The following sections go into detail about the tools presented in the *Player's Handbook*, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.

The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.

#### Skills
Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. As DM, you can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.

With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.

\columnbreak

Additionally, you can consider giving a character extra information or an added benefit on a skill check. The text provides some examples and ideas when this opportunity is relevant.

#### Special Use
Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph.

#### Sample DCs
A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.

##### Item Specific Tools
|Tools&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|Craftable and Modifiable Items|
