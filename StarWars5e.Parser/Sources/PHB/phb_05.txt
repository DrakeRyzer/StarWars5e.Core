# Chapter 5: Equipment

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:90px;left:75px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he marketplace of a large city teems with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buyers and sellers of many sorts: Jawas peddling refurbished wares (or trying to steal from careless travelers), Ugnauts selling various technology scrap, Twi'lek armstechs and Mirialan synthweavers. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.		

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

## Wealth
Wealth generally appears in the form of credits. The Galactic Republic and Sith Empire have their own mints, but in most worlds, the chits are interchangeable. Other trade goods, gemstones, artifacts, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the lower class trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in raw materials. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or a company, or in high denomination credits. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.

### Currency
Credits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with<br> incredible value. While the<br> Republic and Empire have<br> their own currencies, in<br> most worlds they can be<br> used interchangeably.
 
With ten credits, a character can buy a power cell, a stylus, or a glowrod. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. The credit is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the chit itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of credits, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual chits. Rather, the credit is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in credit cards, letters of credit, or valuable goods.			
 
A standard chit weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty chits weigh a pound.	

> The listed cost of lightweapons is equal to twice their vibroweapon counterpart. If you use the **Variant: Starting Wealth** rule, you should consider letting players use the value of the vibroweapon counterpart as their purchase price.
>
> Additionally, lightweapons are a scarce and restricted resource. Finding a buyer for a salvaged lightweapon is often difficult due to their clandestine nature.

### Selling Treasure										
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

#### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Used weapons and armor aren't always in good enough condition to sell.										
    
#### Enhanced Items
Selling enhanced items can be problematic. Finding someone to find an overtuned blaster isn't hard, but the most unique of items are beyond all but the wealthiest denizens. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come across enhanced items to purchase. The value of special equipment is far beyond simple credits and should always be treated as such.

#### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or even another planet.

#### Trade Goods
In the Outer Rim, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—raw materials like bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

## Armor and Shields
The different worlds of Star Wars are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from basic combat suits to heavy battle armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield generator.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of Star Wars.

> ##### Variant: Equipment Sizes
> In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly wookiee won't fit in a jawa's combat suit, and an ugnaught would be swallowed up in a gamorrean's hooded cloak. 
>
> The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of durasteel armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
>
> Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armormech, tailor, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4x100 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

#### Armor and Shield Proficiency
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield generator. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield generator as well.

#### Armor Class (AC)
Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield generator) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

#### Strength
Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

#### Stealth
If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

#### Combat Suit
Combat suits are seen all over the galaxy, and can be found for sale by almost any merchant who dealt in weapons and armor. Many such suits are used by military organizations, such as the Galactic Republic's military, as well as by mercenaries, criminals, bounty hunters and even some Jedi.

The suit itself offers decent protection from most types of attacks while maintaining maximum flexibility and minimum weight. However this armor is only recommended for light skirmishes.

#### Heavy Combat Suit
The heavy combat suit is a type of armor that offers more protection than the basic model of combat suit. The heavy combat suit is heavier overall than other combat suits, and not quite as flexible, but many consider the trade-offs worthwhile. It is a good source of defense from physical attacks and light blaster fire.

### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

#### Light Battle Armor
Providing solid protection for a minimal cost, light battle armor is considered excellent protection for entrenched troops or guards. However, this protection comes at a cost of mobility, limiting its uses by rapidly advancing infantry. Still, it provides more mobility than full battle armor.

#### Battle Armor
Battle armor was constructed<br> from a mesh of metal or<br> composite plates and a<br> padded jumpsuit. Variants<br> of the armor included less<br> plates and more padding for<br> a lighter, though less protect-<br>ive armor, and heavier plating<br> with molded pieces to fit the<br> wearer. Though the armor was<br> available unmodified, most users<br> personalized their armor.

#### Powered Battle Armor
Powered battle armor is a type of armored suit that boosted the abilities of its wearer while offering good protection against most types of weapons. The micro-hydraulics of this type of powered armor provide the operator with both protection and strength enhancement. This type of armor is rarely seen outside of professional mercenaries' and soldiers' use.

\columnbreak

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

#### Durasteel Armor
Durasteel armor is an armor that reduced weight, but restricts movement. The armor is commony used by mercenaries, bounty hunters, soldiers, and civilians that live in dangerous areas.

#### Powered Durasteel Armor
Powered durasteel armor uses the base durasteel armor, with the benefit of micro-hydraulics that boost the efficacy of the operator. It offers better protection, but increased weight.

#### Heavy Durasteel Armor
Heavy durasteel armor is virtually the heaviest armor acquirable during the Galactic War. It is ideal for extreme combat situations that involved direct damage and also offers a very good level of protection in sacrifice of dexterity. Some consider it claustrophobic but that was the trade-off for safety.

### Shield Generators
Shields come in varying weights, sizes, and materials. A light shield generator is generally pretty small, affixing to the forearm or belt. A medium shield generator is generally larger and fills the hand. A heavy shield is larger and made of strong composites. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

#### Light Shield Generator
A light shield generator is generally affixed to the forearm or belt. While a light shield does not fill the hand slot, you gain no benefit from it while the hand is full. You gain no benefit from a light shield while wielding a weapon with the *heavy* property.

#### Medium Shield Generator
A personal shield generator was a defensive technology that projected a field of energy that protected the user from blaster fire, the elements, or other hazards. Most were designed to be held much like a traditional physical shield. The medium shield generator is used in conjunction with any one-handed weapon.

#### Heavy Shield
Rather than an energy shield, heavy shields are physical composites of metal or plastic. They are much larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Its cumbersome size, however, makes it unwieldy, and requires the use of a one-handed weapon with the *light* property in the other hand.

Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls while wielding a heavy shield. A heavy shield's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

### Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

***Don.*** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

***Doff.*** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

## Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of Star Wars, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, including vibroswords vibrolances, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). 

#### Burst
A weapon that has the burst property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to ranged weapon attacks) or take the weapon's normal damage. This consumes an amount of ammunition indicated by the burst number. If the ranged weapon attack would have disadvantage, affected targets instead have advantage.

#### Double
A weapon with the double property functions as if you are wielding two separate weapons. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two-weapon fighting. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

#### Finesse
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

#### Hidden
You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

#### Light
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.

#### Luminous
A weapon with the luminous property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.

#### Range
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

#### Reach
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.

#### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice). You must have one free hand to reload.

#### Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

#### Strength
A weapon with this special property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature.

#### Thrown
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. 

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:-2px'></div>

#### Two-Handed
This weapon requires two hands to use.

#### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.	

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described to the right.

#### Chakram/Light Ring
When you throw a chakram or light ring, you can choose to have it return immediately to your hand. You must have one free hand to catch it.

#### Net
A Large or smaller creature hit by an net is restrained until it is freed. An net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 kinetic or energy damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Hidden Blade
A hidden blade does not fill the hand slot, but you can't use a hidden blade while the hand is full. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength saving throws to avoid being disarmed.

#### Vibrodart
Due to their diminutive size, vibrodarts make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.

#### Vibrolance
You have disadvantage when you use a vibrolance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

#### Wrist Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the wrist launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of darts, small missiles, or specialized canisters.

### Ammunition
#### Carbonite Canister
When triggered, the carbonite canister produces a beam of carbonite energy in a 15 foot line. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier) or take 1d6 cold damage and have its speed halved until the end of your next turn. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.

#### Dart
This wrist launcher ammo deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit.

#### Flame Projector Canister
When triggered, the flame projector canister produces a burst of flame in a 15 foot line or cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier) or take 2d6 fire damage.

#### Missile, Fragmentation
This wrist launcher ammo deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, hit or miss, the missile then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier), taking 1d6 kinetic damage on a failed save.

#### Power Cell
Power cells energize blaster weapons and tools.

#### Plasma Cell
A plasma cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons. The loaded weapon deals fire damage instead of energy, and when you hit with a shot it sets the ground beneath it in a 5-foot square ablaze. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage.

### Explosives
#### Breaching Charge
A device used to blow holes in larger constructs, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

Once detonated, the breaching charge destroys an unenhanced section of wall up to 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 5 feet deep. Additionally, each creature within 20 feet of the charge must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage. If the breaching charge is installed on the construct, it automatically fails the saving throw.

#### Grenade, Electrostun
Electrostun grenades are usually used when the object of a mission is to detain, capture, or subdue rather than kill. Grenades have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. 

#### Grenade, Fragmentation
Frag grenades are cheap, low-damage grenades used mainly by military personnel, mercenaries, bounty hunters, and adventurers. Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer that lasts several seconds before detonating.  Grenades have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or<br> half as much as on a successful one.

#### Grenade, Gas
Gas grenades are primarily used<br> to flush enemies out of cover and<br> other protected areas, though<br> there are of course other uses.<br> Grenades have a range equal to<br> 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5.<br> As an action, you can throw a grenade at<br> a point you can see within range. The grenade explodes in a 15ft radius sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are uneffected.

As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d4 ion damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted. 

#### Mine, Fragmentation
When you use your action to set it, this mine sets an imperceptible laser line extending up to 15 feet. When the laser is tripped, the mine explodes, and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.	

#### Mine, Plasma
When you use your action to set it, this mine sets an imperceptible laser line extending up to 15 feet. When the laser is tripped, the mine explodes, coating the area in a 15-foot radius around it in fire that burns for 1 minute. When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful one. A construct makes this save with disadvantage.

#### Thermal Detonator
Thermal detonators are palm-sized, spherical, and extremely deadly explosive weapons. In addition to being surprisingly powerful for their size, they can only be turned off by whoever turned them on. Thermal detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

#### Flight Suit
Flight suits, or jumpsuits, are a type of outfit worn by pilots. They are worn in conjunction with flight helmets. They come in a variety of different colors and provide life support, and protect from hostile environments.

#### Respirator
A respirator, or breath mask, is a portable device that allowed an oxygen-breather to survive in low-oxygen atmospheres. Although not suitable for use in outer-space, these hands-free masks were essential equipment for deep-space travel that might require activity outside of a starship.

### Medical Supplies
#### Antidote Kit 
An antidote kit contained a variety of wide-spectrum antidote hypospray injectors that were designed to neutralize all known poisons. A kit has five charges. As an action, you can administer a charge of the kit to cure a target of one poison affecting them or to give them advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to droids or constructs.

#### Emergency Battery
All non-expendable droids need recharging as they are used. The battery has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a droid that has 0 hit points, without needing to make an Intelligence (Technology) check.

#### Medkit
A common medkit can be stocked with bacta packs, and contains spray-bandages, bone stabilizers, antiseptics, and other essentials for the treatment of wounds. As an action, you can expend a use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. A medkit can be used to stabilize 5 times before it must be restocked at its original cost.

#### Medpac
A medpac is a quick-acting syringe filled with a concentrated dose of kolto. As an action, you can use a medpac to restore 2d4+2 hit points to a creature within 5 feet.

#### Poison, Basic (One Dose) 
You can use the poison in this vial to coat one kinetic weapon or one wrist launcher dart. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

### Utilities
#### Binders
These durasteel restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the binders requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of binders comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with security kit can pick the binders' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Binders have 15 hit points.

#### Chronometer
A chronometer is a device that measures and keeps linear time.

#### Field Rations (One day's)
Ration packs consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, and are used when other food is scarce. Each pack is divided into portions and can provide enough food for one person per day.

#### Fusion Cutter
A fusion cutter is a handheld cutting tool popular among technicians. It cut through almost any reinforced material, given enough time. The internal power cell supplies an hour's worth of continuous operation.

#### Glowrod
Glowrods create a beam of light illuminating the area around you in bright light for a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The glowrod lasts for 10 hours and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell. 

#### Grappling Hook

#### Mess Kit
This box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

#### Ram, Portable
You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

#### Restraining Bolt
Restraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit. 

Installing a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt.

A small handhold device<br> with a single button, used<br> to activate explosives. Over<br> the course of 1 minute, you<br> can synchronize the deton-<br>ator with a single explosive<br> device, such as a breaching<br> charge, grenade, or mine. As an<br> action, you can remotely detonate<br> the paired explosive.

#### Tracker Utility Vest
A utility vest is a sleeveless item of clothing that includes several evenly-distributed pockets, popular among hunters, smugglers, and adventurers. The vest is made of leathery, hide material to resist rips, corrosion and water. The wearer can carry up to 10 light items (up to 1 lb each) without increasing<br> their total encumbrance.

## Trade Goods
Trade is an essential part of the galactic economy.
Many spacers make their living buying and selling goods along hyperspace routes that connect the galaxy's major worlds.

A merchant may be chartered by an individual or a corporation to deliver goods to a certain port, or move goods along a specified route. During times of war, opportunities abound in the shipping of ammunition and medical supplies. Some traders, seeking to earn a quick profit, may resort to smuggling illegal or restricted cargo on behalf of one of the galaxy's many crime syndicates. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

## Mounts and Vehicles
Mounts and vehicles are the two most common types of on-planet transport. 

### Mounts
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a cart or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of Star Wars, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase, like aiwhas from Kamino. Acquiring such a mount is often an adventure in-and-of itself.

Mounts are governed by Animal Handling proficiency.

#### Barding
Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

#### Saddles
A military saddle braces the rider,<br> helping you keep your seat on an<br> active mount in battle. It gives you<br> advantage on any check you make<br> to remain mounted. An exotic sad-<br>dle is required for riding an exotic<br> mount.

### Vehicles
Vehicles are more common on civilized planets than animal mounts. Vehicles do not have access to barding and do not require saddles. Vehicles vary greatly based on price, speed, carrying capacity, personnel capacity, and armaments (if any). Below are some base costs for standard types of speeders.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | EQUIPMENT</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Expenses					
When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses					
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

<div style='margin-top:76.5px'></div>

##### Lifestyle Expenses					
|	Lifestyle		|	Price/Day	|
|	:--		|	--:	|
|	Wretched		|	—	|
|	Squalid		|	1 cr	|
|	Poor		|	2 cr	|
|	Modest		|	10 cr	|
|	Comfortable		|	20 cr	|
|	Wealthy		|	40 cr	|
|	Aristocratic		|	at least 100 cr 	|

<div style='margin-top:78.5px'></div>

#### Wretched
You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

#### Squalid
You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed diseased.

#### Poor
A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a cantina. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

#### Modest
A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, and the like.

#### Comfortable
Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small domicile in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine establishment. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

#### Wealthy
Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

#### Aristocratic
You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of the affluent. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

> ##### Self-Sufficiency
> The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in cities, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to repair your equipment, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
> 
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

### Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator. 

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

|	Service		|	Pay	|
|	:--		|	:--	|
|	_Speeder_		|		|
|	&emsp;	Between towns	|	3 cr per mile	|
|	&emsp;	Within a city	|   2 cr	|
|	_Hireling_		|		|
|	&emsp;	Skilled	        |  20 cr per day	|
|	&emsp;	Untrained	    |	2 cr per day	|
|	Messenger		                    |	1 cr per mile	|
|	Tolls		                        |	1 cr	        |
|   Interplanetary Travel               | 100 cr per day per person   |
