<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the Aqualish people have two facial tusks which curve down over their mouths; a trait which added to their appearance as arachnids. These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.

While Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.

### Society and Culture
The Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the<br> same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the<br> Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest<br>a attributes.

### Names
Aqualish names are intended to sound strong. Surnames are not familial, but are chosen by each individual Aqualish.

**Male Names.** Bung, Gu, Opege, Soni, Tubop

**Female Names.** Cestirki, Duni, Iftu, Sifre, Umi

**Surnames.** Dogomurra, Julo, Kronem, Nidoal, Utix

### Biology and Appearance
Ardennians are sentient humanoid simians hailing from the tropical paradise of Ardennia. They are covered in fur from head to their wrists and ankles, with brown and grey being the most common fur colors. Ardennians sport four arms and prehensile feet. All six of their limbs are equally dexterous.

### Society and Culture
The Ardennian people themselves are a friendly communal species that are well known for welcoming visitors and inviting newcomers to traditional feasts and dances on the sandy beaches of Ardennia. Rural Ardiennan’s live in modern tree-villages in the thick, dim jungle canopy on the majority of the islands. Ground level accommodations are available for off world visitors even in the smaller villages. Most off-worlders stay in the large modern resort complexes which boast having miles of private beaches or in the modern cities. Several large cities exist, scattered around the world, which typically encompass an entire island or a series of smaller islands joined together.

Ardennia’s distance from the main hyperlanes makes it one of the lesser-known vacation destinations, but it's a popular one for those who don’t mind the extra travel time. Some affluent visitors prefer the solitude that Ardennia offers, and occasionally end up purchasing one of the smaller islands to build their own home. Ardennia is notable for having the most beach per square meter in the galaxy. 

### Names
Ardennian’s names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables, with a familal surname.

**Male Names.** Rio, Jakar, Hul, Lup, Quil, Jerno

**Female Names.** Rac, Bras, Nuc, Kua, Karta, Sanya

**Surnames.** Betal, Durant, Jabut, Karon, Rambuan

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Barabel are a bipedal species of reptilians who are covered in very tough dark colored scales. Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many startled foes. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which can grow to be 2 inches in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the massive amount of food they required to survive.

### Society and Culture
Living in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where the group thrives and hunted from. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess; many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal. They also have a great deal of respect for the Jedi because of their first experiences with a Jedi Master who settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy, are an unknown concept to Barabel and are considered insulting.

### Names
Barabel names are harsh and gutteral. Female names are often softer. Surnames are warren-based.

**Male Names.** Anidroks, Bridiz, Trurzuk, Vilzinok

**Female Names.** Alge, Bulzo, Ekthamo, Inako, Nolku

**Surnames.** Akken, Dutarca, Khigta, Srabulgid, Zhomo

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Bite.*** As a bonus action, you can make a special bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage, and you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Male Besalisks' heads sported prominent crests and four arms hung at their sides; females of the species could have as many as eight arms, but like Humans had a primary hand and a limited range of functionality with the others. The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.

### Society and Culture
Because of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.

While not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business. Trading and making deals, any violence on these stations is committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation.

### Names
Besalisk name's are generally words that embody them, with a surname attached to their commune.

**Male Names.** Darius, Dexter, Plun, Pong

**Female Names.** Delia, Mora, Ren, Teen

**Surnames.** Jettster, Kil, Krell, Ugg

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:531px'></div>

### Besalisk Traits
As a Besalisk, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Besalisks reach adulthood in their early teens and generally live to be about 70.

***Alignment.*** Besalisks tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Besalisks tower over almost all other species, with the smallest standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 200 lbs., and the largest approaching 8 feet tall and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Four-Armed.*** Besalisks have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Besalisk.

### Biology and Appearance
The Cathar have fur-covered bodies with thick manes as well as prominent, retractable claws that can deliver powerful killing attacks on foes and prey. Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.

The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.

### Society and Culture
On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt," in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.

### Names
Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are usually one syllable.

**Male Names.** Crurbirr, Isyrr, Nynorr, Suro, Tukarr

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Cereans' enlarged skulls, extending above their foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as<br> humans. 

### Society and Culture
Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean's daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.

### Names
Cerean male first names are often hyphenated, while females are not. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Ji-Cheelia, Ki-Adi, Pick-toh, Sauli-Fanz

**Female Names.** Dreash, Kilniavy, Melm, Rharoth, 

**Surnames.** Codux, Emkom, Kyureft, Lonnik, Mundi

### Biology and Appearance
Chadra-Fan are covered from head to foot in fur. Their species evolved from small, arboreal rodents. The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other species, though the Chadra-Fan could readily tell the difference using their powerful sense of smell. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.

### Society and Culture
The society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan's children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home.

Chadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness

### Names
Chadra-Fan names do not vary significantly based on sex. Surnames are clan based.

**First Names.**  Dubi, Kattar, Naska, T'yabah, O'yasha

**Surnames.** Abalomm, Fandy, Nemm, Nuz, Yedit

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Chagrians are born as tadpoles in clutches of three or more and raised in tubs of water in a family's private home. During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs develop. Adult Chagrians are truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possess acute low-light vision.

The average Chagrian stands taller than a Human. They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.

### Society and Culture
As a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and health-care. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.

### Names
Chagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Bom, Chen, Fiet, Nedd, Touk

**Female Names.**  Chavik, Dabai, Fisil, Oolya, Tinto

<div style='margin-top:67px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Chevin have long snouts which hang down nearly to their ankles. Combined with their intellect, this makes them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they can smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It is also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin have thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground.

### Society and Culture
Chevin live in small, mobile communities, with homes mounted on great wheeled carts. Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.

The only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements are movable when necessary. Each of the roughly two dozen Government Villages rules a Chevin nation.

### Names
Chevin names do not vary significantly based on gender. Surnames are based on community.

**First Names.** Buula, Ephant, Perre, Phylus, Reseros

**Surnames.** Meh, Mon, Nen, Needmo, Phrusaani

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:531px'></div>

### Chevin Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Chevin reach adulthood in their thirties and live up to 200 years.

***Alignment.*** Chevin warmongering and slavetrading cause them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Chevin stand between 6 and 8 feet tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to both hot and cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

***Nomadic.*** You are proficient in Survival.

***Thick Skull.*** Your skull is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Chevin. The Chevin language is characterized by grunts and low-pitched rumblings. Chevin typically have deep voices, even when speaking Basic.

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Codru-Ji are humanoids generally near-Human in their adult appearances, save for their four arms. While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.

Codru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent. They do, however, retain both the natural resilience and the enhanced hearing of their previous selves.

### Society and Culture
The Codru-Ji are proud and protective of their ancient customs, and they carefully manage their homeworld's economy to keep a degree of anonymity from the galaxy at large. They fear the tainting of their long-held practices by outside influence as well as prejudice against them for the almost barbaric level of callousness they will display towards one another in pursuit of personal gain. The kidnapping of a political rivals' children or the ransoming of off-worlders back to their people are both common practices. 

### Names
Codru-Ji names are often kept to two syllables. Clan names are appended to the given name as a hyphenated affix.

**Male Names.** Kossok, Tirrit, Uttar, Yunnan

**Female Names.** Davvi, Kella, Russa, Zollu 

**Clan Names.** -Fa, -Mu, Ro-, -Sy, Yi-

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:470px'></div>

### Codru-Ji Traits
As a Codru-Ji, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Codru-Ji reach adulthood in their early teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Steeped in selfish tradition, Codru-Ji tend towards the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Codru-Ji stand 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Four-Armed.*** Codru-Ji have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Hide.*** You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Keen Hearing.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

***Natural Grappler.*** Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple you are considered to have expertise in the Athletics skill.

***Trance.*** Codru-Ji sleep lightly, standing and semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Codruese, which has a solemn and stately cadence to it.

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their<br> appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have<br> silver-based blood, which appears thick and black<br> when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration<br> and cleansing system which processes through two<br> livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of<br> toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant<br> to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on<br> Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because<br> inhaling it causes the substance to enter the<br> bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate<br> sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use<br> can be dangerous.

### Society and Culture
Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. 

### Names
Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.

**Male Names.** Cir, Gremegris, Keirtihk, Kucx, Niruhk

**Female Names.** Crilnuy, Ghal, Milma, Nola, Taoluel 

**Surnames.** Breiz, Droddost, G'vaulnel, Raokt

<div style='margin-top:486px'></div>

### Devaronian Traits
As a Devaronian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by<br> 1.

***Age.*** Devaronians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Devaronians' greediness causes them to tend toward chaotic balanced, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Devaronians typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 160 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Jungle Dweller.*** Growing up in the jungles of Devaron has left an impact. You are proficient in Survival. Additionally, you don't treat jungle terrain as difficult terrain.

***Tech Resistance.*** Devaronians have a history of using technology as a weapon. You have advantage on saving throws against tech powers.

***Two Livered.*** Devaronians have two livers, which makes them adept at filtering toxins. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Devaronese. Devaronese is characterized by grunts and grumbles. It is rare to hear a Devaronian speak it any where other than their homeworld of Devaron.

<div style='margin-top:80px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Draethos possess large teeth, which grow outside of their mouths. Coupled with their lack of lips, this leads to the appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple to black. Their hands retain an interstitial web between the fingers. Their fingers end in narrow tips which resemble claws. They possess low-light vision, springing from their cave-dwelling ancestors.

Draethos possess a limited telepathy, granting the ability to communicate with any sentient being. The ability is limited to communication; a Draethos can not invade the thoughts of others.

### Society and Culture
Partly due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. The Draethos' culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens. Consequently, despite their reputation as fierce combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld are peaceful and intellectual.

### Names
Due to their lack of lips, Draethos names typically lack hard consonants. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Odan, Gyeto, Hurl, Jan, Talon

**Female Names.** Gillen, Teria, Kat’h, Yul, Aswe

**Surnames.** Urr, Slyter, Qelu’tlapa, Ayahu, Jek

***Alignment.*** Draethos tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Draethos typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh around 190 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Way of the Warrior.*** You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as vibroblades and vibroswords.

***Telepathy.*** You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you. You must share a language with the target in order to communicate in this way.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Draethos. Draethos is characterized by its flurry of cacophonous sighs and clicks.

<div style='margin-top:79px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Dugs are slender, powerfully built beings with a somewhat humanoid build and a unique method of walking that hailed from the high gravity world Malastare. Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.

### Society and Culture
Due to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.

On their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.

### Names
Dug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful. Surnames are usually passed down through family or clan.

**Male Names.** Bawugri, Gadwouhx, Rorgukwa, 

**Female Names.** Bosix, Grugne, Jiwous, Pragiba, 

**Surnames.** Brundaare, Gninsaidi, Kedwir, Randaine

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:500px'></div>

### Dug Traits
As a dug, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Dugs reach adulthood in their early teens and live an average of 75 years. Their violent nature often leads to violent ends.

***Alignment.*** Dugs' angry nature causes them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Dugs typically stand between 3 and 4 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Courageous.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

***Fury of the Small.*** When you damage a creature with an attack or a power and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or power to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

***Strong and Small.*** You have a climbing speed of 25 feet.

***Powerful Build.*** You count as two sizes larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Dug.

### Biology and Appearence
Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to "little bears," though they are sometimes referred to as "mini Wookiees."

### Society and Culture
Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a "Central Village" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.

Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.

### Names
Ewok names are comprised of growled consonants. Female names always end in a vowel. Surnames are clan-based.

**Male Names.** Coostick, Erphek, Grarphil, Moodoo

**Female Names.** Booshi, Chela, Fesasha, Lipe, Ypezzi

**Surnames.** Fedrimra, Jellyng, Moomrack, Trantelaa

***Size.*** Ewoks stand between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh about 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Crude Weapon Specialists.*** Ewoks are used to making do with less. You can spend 1 hour, which you can do over the course of a short rest, crafting a weapon out of loose materials. You can craft any simple kinetic weapon, but the weapon's damage suffers a -1 penalty.

<div style='margin-top:48px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Falleen are distinguished by their mottled green or red skin, ridged skulls, and their long, black hair which they typically wear in ponytails. The sleek symmetry of their features, calculating and cold demeanors, their exotic looks, and their ability to alter their skin pigmentation make the Falleen often considered to be among the most aesthetically pleasing beings in the galaxy. In addition to their strikingly beautiful appearance, the Falleen exude pheromones which makes them all but irresistible to both sexes.

The Falleen are semi-aquatic, being able to hold their breath underwater for an extended period of time. Fallen are one of few species that are resistant to manipulation by the Force.

### Society and Culture
Falleen society is of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower classes. The upper echelons of Falleen aristocracy are rife with politics and intrigue, though they rarely spill blood over disputes or reduce themselves to open warfare.

As a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control, particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control. Indeed, the Falleen as a species have a towering sense of superiority, reflecting on their view of Falleen as the civilized and cultural center of the galaxy, rather than Coruscant.

### Names
Falleen favor names with Z and X sounds. They are usually accompanied by a surname, which is familial.

**Male Names.** Xomit, Xizor, Xist, Zenex, Zurros

**Female Names.** Xora, Trezza, Mylla, Zule, Annaz

**Surnames.** Grunseit, Croom, Moz, Xiss, Mythric

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:456px'></div>

### Falleen Traits
As a Falleen, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Falleen reach adulthood in their late teens and live up to 250 years. 

***Alignment.*** Falleen societal structure causes them to<br> tend to be lawful balanced, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Falleen typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 165 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Closed Mind.*** Falleen brains have an unusual composition which make them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on saving throws against force powers.

***Enthralling Pheromones.*** You can use your pheromones to influence individuals of both sexes. Whenever you roll a 1 on a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Additionally, once per short or long rest, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower on a Charisma check as a 10. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Hold Breath.*** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time.

***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Falleen. Falleen is characterized by its common use of the Z and X sounds, of which the Falleen are fond.

<div style='margin-top:64px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Felucians are a tall, bipedal species. Both their arms and legs end in four, large webbed digits with suction-cup fingertips. Springing from the underside of each forearm is a second short arm, ending in three large and agile fingers. A Felucian's head is a thick mass of long flexible tendrils featuring illuminated tips. The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.

### Society and Culture
Felucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.

The Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.

All Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains. These shamans are very strong in the Force, using it to their own ends with incredible skill.

### Names
Felucian names are usually two syllables and full of hard consonants. Surnames are a combination of tribe lineage.

**Male Names.** Gokkuul, Kargrek, Hagark, Ruggorn

**Female Names.** Lakko, Taarell, Duuna, Frula 

**Surnames.** s'Gokuul, d'Lakko, s'Kargrek, d'Frula

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:516px'></div>

### Felucian Traits
As a Felucian, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Felucians reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Felucians' connection to the Living Force causes them to tend toward the light side, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Felucians typically stand over 6 feet tall and generally weigh about 200 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Force Sensitive.*** You know the *burst* at-will force power. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *beast trick* force power once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *plant surge* force power once per day. Wisdom is your forcecasting ability for these powers.

***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.

***Stealthy.*** You are proficient in the Stealth skill.

***Mask of the Wild.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Although a typical Gamorrean is squat, green, and heavily built not all shared these characteristics. Most Gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The Gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.

### Society and Culture
Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession. 

### Names
Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family. 

**Male Names.** Ark, Blarrp, Blubrak, Cuab, Shos

**Female Names.** Dabrisz, Mernoos, Ogreb, Tagorq

**Surnames.** Doofnarq, Griks, Lurc, Poogmokk

<div style='margin-top:36px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Gand are sentient, stocky humanoids whose insectoid bodies are covered in a chitinous exoskeleton. The natural armor allow the Gand to shrug off injuries that would cripple most other species. The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days. 

### Society and Culture
Gand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all<br> called "Gand," as they are considered merely aspects<br> of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the<br> use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as<br> becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given<br> name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner<br> of speaking us common within the spoken and written<br> Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand<br> speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to<br> outsiders.

### Names
Until a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term "Gand." Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves "Gand" until they prove themselves again. Male and female names are not distinct.

**First Names.** C'nyir, Dash, Iglid, Kyuffax, T'rix

**Surname.** Diqlu, Krakee, Praafri, Quudya, Zooq

<div style='margin-top:19px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Geonosians have a hard chitin exoskeleton that provided protection from physical impacts and bouts of radiation that occasionally shower their world. Geonosians are strong despite their thin builds, and are capable of constructing massive hives and factories in concert. The head of a Geonosian is elongated and large with their skulls ridged on the top and by the side where they have bulbous, thick-lidded eyes. Both are physically strong and covered with bony ridges which protected their arms, legs, and vital organs. 

### Society and Culture
Geonosian societ is caste-based with little upward mobility, though some of the lower caste do develop ambition. Workers are conditioned to loathe even the concept of separation from their hive and the system<br> of control. A low-ranking worker's normal life is one of<br> endless toil and labor to satisfy the aristocracy, who<br> are known to make spectacular demands. The warrior<br> caste tend to be highly competitive and are eager to<br> prove themselves. They are born with an abnormal<br> level of intelligence, and one of their only hopes of<br> escape from their rigid duty is entering voluntarily into<br> gladiatorial combat. Should they survive, they are<br> granted freedom. Ultimately, their society exist to<br> benefit those few members that reside in the upper<br> caste. Members of the aristocratic classes are known to<br> be ambitious, domineering, and manipulative. They<br> constantly move towards improving their standing and<br> holdings while sumultaneously working to ruin their<br> rivals.

### Names
Geonosian names are usually harsh sounding. Lower castes don't get surnames. Upper caste surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Buck, Goshey, Nik, Sozz, Techtu

**Female Names.** Datte, Kida, Miri, Nare, Tenessi

**Surnames.** Chak, Hor, Lur, Marpes, Zol

<div style='margin-top:34px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Gran can easily be identified by their three eyes and their goat-like snout. Female Gran also have three breasts. They have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even able to see into the infrared, thus they are able to sense one another's emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen. A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.

### Society and Culture
The peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society. 

The Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran are educated for a specific job that best served his or her talents.

### Names
Gran names typically are monosyllabic and accompanied by a surname, which is familial.

**Male Names.** Ask, Dree, Ree, Pax, Nic

**Female Names.** Yan, Alijia, Meeb, Sir, Zeek

**Surnames.** Moe, Leem, Yees, Wix, Naaq

<div style='margin-top:35px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.

### Society and Culture
Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.

If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders. 

### Names
Gungan names are often repeated syllables hyphenated.

**Male Names.** Crinn-Crinn, Gic, Noc-Noc, Wal

**Female Names.** Hew, Khi, La-La, Phro-Phro, Yuss

**Surnames.** Baud, Gos, Jalles, Mag, Wub

<div style='margin-top:95px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Harch possess a large-fanged mouth between two prominent chelicerae, above which they have six red eyes arranged in a semicircle. The two lowest eyes are larger and roughly twice the size of the four smaller eyes. Harch walk on two legs and have six arms, with the second and third set of arm protruding from behind the first pair rather than directly above or below them. These arms are covered in thick hair and end in three-fingered hands.

The Harch are distantly related to the Aqualish<br> species and there is much debate among geneticists<br> regarding the relationship between the Harch and the<br> Aqualish Ualaq subspecies. However, the Harch<br> themselves considered such discussions to be<br> obscene.

### Society and Culture
Not much is known about the Harch, as few of them have mingled with the galactic community, preferring to stay on Secundus Ando. Harch that leave the planet tend to have a more aspirant nature than their fellows, and often reach great heights in their chosen professions in the galaxy. Such Harch are considered outliers—most apparently care little for titles.

Like the Arcona species, female Harch are seen as more domineering and aggressive than their male counterparts. It is not unheard of for a male Harch to raise entire broods of hatchlings alone.

### Names
Harch names are not gender-specific. Harch do not use surnames.

**Names.** Cubach, Quixoch, Trench, Turch

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:320px'></div>

### Harch Traits
As a Harch, you have the following special traits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Intelligence, and Constitution scores increase by 1.

***Age.*** Harch reach adulthood at age 10 and can live up to 200 years.

***Alignment.*** Harch are cold, calculating beings, causing them to tend toward the dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Harch stand around 6 feet tall and weigh between 200 and 300 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You have a keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bite.*** Your fangs are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage.

***Six-Armed.*** Harch have six arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).

***Spider Climb.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing, and while climbing you always have two hands free.

***Venomous Fangs.*** As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can't use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Harchese. Harchese is discernible from other insectoid languages by a noticeable emphasis on consonants, especially the "ch" sound.

<div style='margin-top:64px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
The Herglic are a massive race of creatures descended<br> from aquatic mammals, breathing though a blowhole<br> on top of their heads. They are tall and wide, and have<br> smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale<br> blue to black, though some rare individuals may<br> appear pink or have white markings on their sides.<br> Their girth tends to leave them feeling out of place among smaller species; Herglic tend to take up two chairs or fill the entire doorway of any establishment they enter that does not cater to beings their size.

### Society and Culture
The Herglics are very technologically advanced, developing space flight and hyperdrives and colonizing their sector of the galaxy prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic. Natural explorers and traders, they sailed the cosmos establishing crucial trade routes and gaining prestige. Despite their size, Herglic are surprisingly dextrous while working with tools, and are some of the finest engineers in the galaxy. 

Herglics have an inquisitive but practical nature, enjoying travel and having exotic experiences. Their perpetually calm demeanor  helps them interact with most other species peacefully, though when dealing with smaller species, Herglics tend to become nervous and self-conscious about their proportions. They also seem to have an innate predeliction for gambling and games of chance, which have gotten more than one Herglic into trouble on several occasions.

### Names
Male names are typically harsher sounding than female names. Herglics rarely use surnames.

**Male Names**
Biglu, Melchi, Sehvorah

<div style='margin-top:49px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Iktotchi do not have hair, but rather they had a very resistant skin which protected them from the violent winds which crossed the satellite. Both males and females have down-curved cranial horns, which gave them an aggressive aspect. The males' horns are generally a little larger, a remnant from their mountain-dwelling, caprinaen ancestors. The horns are able to regenerate if damaged.

### Society and Culture
The Iktotchi are a fiercely guarded and isolationist species - vaunted for their ability to hide their feelings and bury any semblance of emotion. Originating on the harsh, windy moon of Iktotch, which orbits the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region, the Iktotch are gifted with precognition, and are courted as often by Jedi as by pirates for their skills.

Iktotchi society is a stratified society. Upward mobility is both possible and encouraged. Iktotchi are an outwardly dispassionate people, which is evidenced by their culture. They have a robust legal system, and suffer little crime. Iktotchi are respectful of cultures other than their own and can easily integrate with others.

Iktotchi who distinguish themselves often earn a titular nickname, by which they are referred to in place of their name. Generally, this is done by accomplishing a remarkable feat that benefits the Iktotchi as whole.

### Names
Iktotchi names are generally two syllables. Surnames are familial. Respected Iktotchi often adopt a nickname, which they use in place of their birth name.

**Male Names.** Dilnam, Imruth, Kashkil, Yellam

**Female Names.** Kemkal, Onyeth, Reshu, Zorlu

**Surnames.** Hevil, Kaawi, Mimir, Nudaal, Zelend

***Telepathy.*** You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of you. You must share a language with the target in order to communicate in this way.

***Horns.*** Your horns are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.

***Pilot.*** You have proficiency in the Piloting skill.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ithorians have two mouths and four throats, allowing them to speak in stereo. Female Ithorians have two humps on the back of their head, while males have only one. They have glossy, usually brown flesh. Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.

In addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians' four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.

### Society and Culture
Ithorians worship the "Mother Jungle," a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their "Law of Life."

### Names
Ithorian names are quite varied in length but most names are soft and melodic. They are often difficult to prounounce by other species, so many Ithorians adopt nicknames.

**Male Names.** Del, Gizorthej, Pexxocl, Steorthibs

**Female Names.** Binshe, Dhu'sha, Mul, Slosh, Vlo

**Surnames.** Afleehl, Crukid, Tondand, Wamunn

Kaleesh society is divided into numerous autonomous tribes. War is viewed as an essential and sacred practice, and the culture's large emphasis on honor is known to spur many acts of vengeance among the various tribes. However, when necessary, the tribes will put aside their differences and bond to fend off a common enemy.

The Kaleesh are a spiritual people, believing that those who perform great deeds in life became gods in death; therefore, burial places are sacred to them. A large number of temples are devoted to their ancestor gods, the holiest of which was called Shrupak.

### Biology and Appearance
Kaminoans’ evolution from aquatic creatures in the vast oceans of Kamino is reflected in their tall shape, glassy coated eyes, near luminescent skin, and long, thin necks. The almond-shaped eyes of Kaminoans are also able to see color in the ultraviolet spectrum. While female Kaminoans are bald, males possess headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous skulls.

### Society and Culture
The Kaminoans see themselves as a superior form of life, but nevertheless remained polite to outsiders. To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society. Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the Kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction. 

Kaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the Kaminoan's eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks. Although it is extremely rare, Kaminoans are sometimes born with green eyes. Those are viewed as genetically inferior and as a threat to the Kaminoans' well ordered society and as such are exterminated shortly after birth. 

### Names
Kaminoan names typically are composed by around two syllables and a brief surname.

**Male Names.** Lama, Ni, Orun, Koa

**Female Names.** Taun, Ko, Nala, Kina

**Surnames.** Ha, Su, We, Sai, Wa

### Biology and Appearance
The amphibious Karkarodons have tall, slim bodies with webbed hands and feet. Their shark-like heads have pointed noses, gill slits, and many rows of razor-sharp teeth, which they use when attacking and eating. Karkarodons are skilled and fast swimmers. They attack by grabbing the target and used their jaws for ripping and tearing.

### Society and Culture
Karkarodons hail from the planet Karkaris, which is located in a star system neighboring the planet Mon Cala. They harbor an intense hatred for the Mon Calamari and Quarren inhabitants. The planet is almost entirely under water, and is very uninviting to non-Karkarodons. 

Karkarodon culture is a warmongering, strength-based culture. Clans often fight eachother for dominance, natural resources, and to cull the weak. Each clan on the planet has a ruling triumvirate, usually comprised of venerated warriors who rule for life. When a younger Karkarodon wants to replace one of the ruling body, they challenge them to single, mortal combat. Occasionally, the challenged may spare the life of the challenger when they win, though that usually leads to resentment from the loser.

Karkarodons do not believe in lying or duplicity. They believe in approaching problems head on and saying what they mean, and are generally demeaing towards those they deem their lessers.

### Names
Karkarodon names are harsh and gutteral. They are generally one syllable. Surnames are clan-based rather than familial.

A willing creature can submit to this telepathy to become a Joiner. They effectively become another vessel of the hive mind.

Killiks lose connection to their hive mind at great distances. Those who voluntarily leave the hive mind are referred to as Leavers. It is rare that they are allowed to rejoin their hive without reason.

### Names

### Biology and Appearance
A lanky, bipedal humanoid species, the Kyuzo originate on the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of Phatrong. Kyuzo are tall and slender, though their appearance belies their strength and quickness. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld's atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear corrective lenses and a highly pressurized filter mask over their faces to protect their sensitive respiratory systems and assist them in coping with uncomfortable climates like galactic standard habitable environments. As well as causing respiratory and vision problems, exposure to such conditions causes a Kyuzo to become ill within in a short period of time, interfering with their ability to concentrate and slowing them down.

### Society and Culture
A species known for its strong sense of justice and honor, most Kyuzo regard oaths and contracts as unbreakable and many species seek them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel and bounty hunters. A highly political species, the Kyuzo developed societies that span considerable geographical areas, and most identify as members of a particular country or region. Most major islands and continents on Phatrong are their own political units, though they do form a loose confederacy.

### Names
Male names typically end in vowels, while female names end in consonants. Surnames are based on region.

**Male Names.** Drego, Embo, Khalu, Mhali, Zuvio

<div style='margin-top:36px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Lannik are short, bipedal humanoids with droopy, long ears. Males and females are equally tall, although the latter have a considerably less strong complexity. Their species is, however, much more vigorous and resistant than what its size could suggest. A Lannik's skin tends to be of colours similar to his or her eyes and hair. The species has evolved long pointy ears which allow them to hear better than human ears. 

### Society and Culture
The Lannik culture is apparently war loving, and Lanniks feel a great respect for warriors. At the same time, though, they follow a strict centuries-old code of honour. Lannik soldiers have the custom of tying all their hair in a single topknot over their head. Their species is one of fierce warriors, whose abilities have developed fighting against terrible predators and other Lanniks in a long history of wars. Although many regard the Lannik as hotheaded and temperamental, they are quite fearless and clear-headed even in combat, giving them the ability to think their way out of a dangerous situation.

The Lannik do not show their thoughts through their facial expressions, and seem always angry to other species. They are also very stubborn, and are not likely to change career once they chose it. Most males - and many females - serve in the planetary militia, celebrating the species' past as a warrior species. Some take on off-world mercenary work.

### Names

**Male Names.** Minch, Oteg, Vandar, Yaddle, Yoda

**Female Names.** Giro, Lina, Penny, Vona, Zeya

### Biology and Appearence
A humanoid sentient species, Lasats are notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility, with their muscular digitigrade legs enabling them to run faster, jump higher and farther, and move more quietly than humans. Their large finger pads and prehensile toes assist them in climbing. In addition, their large eyes and ears afford them superior sight and hearing over humans. They had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat.

### Society and Culture
Lasat society is held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Within the species, those with fighting skills are highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld<br> of Lira San. Bo-rifles are a long-standing tradition in<br> Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of<br> Lasan. The warrior way of the Lasat is the Boosahn<br> Keeraw. When a Lasat is bested by a superior<br> opponent in combat, they would give them their<br> weapon.

Facial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of<br> their species. Juvenile Lasat are noted to climb tree<br> branches. 

### Names
Lasat names tend to be melodic, with the occasionally harsh tone sprinkled in. Surnames are born by communities within Lasat culture rather than individual families.

**Male Names.** Brob, Drim, Krus, Parred, Volares

**Female Names.** Denazo, Gume, Hado, Zanisa

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
The Miraluka are a Near-Human species that differs from Humans in that they lack eyes, only retaining vestigial eye sockets, and perceive the environment around them through *force sight* instead of regular vision. This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can "see" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varies by individual.

### Society and Culture
Miraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves "brothers" and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if 'shown' life not connected to the Force. 

Many Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.

Miraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member's personal life.

### Names
Miraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don't use surnames, as they believe they are one<br> family.

**Male Names.** Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth

**Female Names.** Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth

When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *force confusion* power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for these powers.

***Force Sight.*** Miraluka perceive the environment around them through use of the Force. You are constantly under the effects of the force power *force sight*, though the power does not require concentration for you. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Miralukese.

### Biology and Appearence
Mirialans are a near-human species native to the planet Mirial. They have green to yellow skin and tattoos on their faces. The Mirialans are known for their spirituality and strong connection with the world around them. Mirialans are very flexible and agile, making them fast and formidable foes.

### Society and Culture
The Mirialan people are deeply religious and practice a primitive understanding of the Force. They believe<br> each individual's actions contribute to their destiny,<br> building upon past successes and failures to drive<br> them towards their fates. Within their belief system<br> was the view that individual actions ripple through the<br> Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a<br> whole.

A Mirialan often places a unique, geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they have completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos often acts as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was. Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans do not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes is incredibly subtle and changes their meaning greatly.

### Names
Mirialan names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Boca, Floha, Jemy, Puv, Choqa

**Female Names.** Buf, Ches, Kebe, Ovof, Shaqa

### Biology and Appearance
Muuns are tall, gaunt humanoids with thin bodies, long<br> limbs, and elongated hairless heads. They typically<br> have pale pink or white skin, most likely derived from<br> their propensity for staying indoors. Muuns have tiny<br> ears on the middle of the sides of their heads, flat<br> noses, and slim mouths which leads to a<br> commonly nasally voice.

### Society and Culture
Muuns believe in tradition, with an established culture based on intelligence and merit. A class-based hierarchy, Muuns consider the  the intellectual pursuits — financiers, lawyers, engineers, diplomats, scientists — as the highest levels of society. Muun culture, and life, revolves around economics and finance. Intense competition among coworkers encourages economic growth, increased productivity, and superior work ethic. Muuns also have a fundamental respect for justice, though they typically adhere to the letter of the law rather than the spirit.

Since Muuns tend to shy away from fighting and physical pursuits, Muun society relies on alternative means for their planet's protection, using vast financial resources to purchase massive floating defense platforms to defend their civilization from attack.

### Names
Muun names are typically clear and concise, rarely containing more than two syllables, with familial surnames.

**Male Names.** Clu, Hego, Nix, Pors, San

**Female Names.** Dax, Efra, Gil, Rel, Ter

***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

***Three Hearts.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Muun. The Muuns' admiration of mathematics carries over into their language, which bares a striking resemblance to Binary.

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Nautolans possess physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage make them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. 

### Society and Culture
The society developed by the Nautolans on Glee Anselm is centralized around local families and governments. The centralized government of Glee Anselm is comprised of representatives from the Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful politicians as well as the most aged members of the society. A culture that promotes life-long mates, Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the household. Arranged marriages are not uncommon. 

No cultural affinity for the Force ever developed on Glee Anselm, though members of the Nautolan species recognize its importance and respected those among them that were Forceful.

### Names
Nautolan names are generally short and melodic. Female names usually end in a vowel. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Brod, Knirkoc, Peng, Tikuwik, Zesufreat

**Female Names.** Doli, Hahi, Thamlymyo, Usha, Zezu

***Age.*** Nautolans reach adulthood in their early teens and live about 70 years on average.

***Alignment.*** Nautolans' benevolence cause them to<br> tend toward the light side, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underwater, you have superior vision in low light conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Insightful.*** Nautolan head tentacles are adept at determining moods. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions.

***Swim.*** You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Nautila. Nautila is unique in that it can only be properly pronounced underwater due to its use of pheromones in addition to spoken sounds. In any other environment, the language loses a great amount of detail; that Nautolans find this annoying.

### Biology and Appearance
Noghri are a primitive humanoid species hailed from the planet Honoghr with steely gray-blue skin that are renowned assassins. A natural gift for stealth and<br> hand-to-hand combat, Noghri are efficient killing<br> machines with their rending claws and strong olfactory<br> sense that can often determine familial lineage. Their smaller size belies their ruthlessness and potent<br> hunting skills.

### Society and Culture
Noghri culture relies heavily on honor, with society being clan-based, revolving around the Dukha, a community center in each village. The greatest strength of the Noghri stems from their loyalty and secrecy; when a Noghri takes a job, they always fulfill it, even if it would result in their death. As such, they make exceptional, albeit expensive bodyguards.

Noghri are loathe to fight with weapons larger than small daggers, believing combat to be a personal celebration to be sullied by use of heavier weapons. As such, it is rare (though not impossible) to see a Noghri wielding a weapon larger than their forearm.

Each Noghri clan village centers around the Dukha, with each clan being led by a Dynast. The Dukha is inhabited by the clan's Maitrakh, who functions as the storyteller, spiritual leader, and lore keep of the clan.

### Names
Noghri names vary from short to long, with female names being typically softer. Surnames are clan-based.

**Male Names.** Cakhmaim, Ezrakh, Khabarakh, Rukh

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Ortolans are squat, heavily-built humanoid bipeds with long, trunklike noses and beady black eyes. They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in<br> four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not<br> opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz<br> resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body.<br> Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them<br> forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their<br> business affairs by their attachment to food,<br> sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts<br> when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions<br> are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find<br> success as chefs or musicians. 

### Society and Culture
Ortolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education. 

While most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.

### Names
Ortolan names are generally short with big sounds. Female names are typically softer. Surnames are familial.

**Male names.** Donmb, Hegh, Nax, Parm, Teeb

**Female names.** Bedla, Folfe, Nelni, Phoff, Sallo

***Alignment.*** Ortolans' love of food and music causes them to tend toward chaotic light side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Ortolans stand around 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh about 55 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Foragers.*** Whenever you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to forage for food you are considered to have expertise in the Survival skill.

***Grovel, Cower, and Beg.*** As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes.

In the two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces, Quarren have gill-like structures that are actually hearing organs. The Quarren are also capable of spitting out clouds of ink as a defensive measure.

### Society and Culture
Quarren are a very self-centered and proud species, almost to the point of being xenophobic, would coincides with their isolationist behavior. Quarren find Humans to be very crude beings and think Galactic Basic to be very cumbersome and unsuitable for speech. The Quarren instead speak their native language more frequently.

The Quarren are conservative and practical in their thinking, yet they reminisce more than they look to the future. The Quarren are isolationist, preferring to stay in the depths of the oceans of their homeworld. However, some Quarren make their living in the galaxy as business managers and accountants. The Quarren diligently mine metal ore from the deepest parts of the ocean, where they live deep beneath the waves. Their cities stretch far below the surface.

### Names
Quarren names are typically harsh. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are familial.

<div style='margin-top:65px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
The Rattataki are a Near-Human species characterized by their nimble movements, chalk-white skin and oft-bald heads. Virtually isolated from the rest of the galaxy, the Rattataki developed a violent society on their home planet of Rattatak, which involves extensive gladiatorial combat. 

### Society and Culture
While most other inhabitants of Rattatak came from the Unknown Regions, there are a significant number of off-worlder mercenaries who come to Rattatak from time to time, likely to view or participate in gladiatorial combat, only to be stranded there permanently. The remarkably harsh conditions on the planet nearly drove its population to extinction. For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet's limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.

Rattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving. Punishment for even the smallest crimes is unnecessarily harsh, which does little to quell that behavior. In fact, Rattataki who are known to commit crimes without being caught are celebrated.

### Names
Rattataki names are harsh sounding and short. Surnames are familial, though many Rattataki abandon them in favor of self-aggrandizing titles.

**Male Names.** Aidus, Charnagus, Karok, Veran

**Female Names.** Amaran, Kassien, Silas, Sraja, Vol

**Surnames.** Anjek, Danvik, Degger, Kolla, Venkorr

<div style='margin-top:36px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Rishii are a sentient, avian species of carnivores which possess two legs ending in four-toed feet, two arms, a tail, and a head. The species' two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii's head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow. Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight. 

### Society and Culture
Native to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet's mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.

### Names
As with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. Rishii names do not vary based on gender. Rishii are responsive to nicknames given by outsiders. 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:516px'></div>

### Rishii Traits
As a Rishii, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Rishii reach adulthood at 10 and generally live no longer than 60 years.

***Alignment.*** Rishii tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Rishii range from 4 to 6 feet tall and generally weigh less than 130 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.

***Mimicry.*** You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic<br> Basic and Rishii. Rishii's clicks, trills, and whistles are<br> difficult for outsiders to learn without the aid of a<br> protocol droid, and so Rishii often feel comfortable<br> speaking to eachother in the language in front of<br> others.

### Biology & Appearance
The Selkath are an aquatic species, known for being skilled swimmers and diplomats. Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.

All members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.

### Society & Culture
Selkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.

Manaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism.

Shistavanen have pronounced muzzles, sharp claws, long pointed teeth, and pointed ears set on top of their heads. Shistavanen also possess large glowing eyes, and can also run at high speeds for long periods without getting tired, alternately using two or four limbs. As predators, they possess keen hearing and smell and excellent night vision.

### Society and Culture
As a species, the Shistavanen are isolationists. The species colonized all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen, and their restrictive trade laws (which are unapologetic in how they favor their own kind over off-world traders).  Most of their society uses<br> technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though<br> some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less<br> sophisticated technology.

A minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen. Due to their natural predatory instincts, Shistavanen commonly find employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters. Many other species react badly to Shistavanen, since their isolationist culture makes them an unfamiliar sight, and their predatory appearance put other species on edge.

### Names
Shistavanen first names typically sound graceful, while their surnames are more gutteral. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Bustuc, Hulvav, Kembol, Nemdav, Sirul

**Female Names.** Gaeft, Laer, Recloz, Shaalir, Thovnim

<div style='margin-top:21px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Squibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an<br> olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance<br> and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating<br> through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when<br> rubbed against. The species has both male and female<br> sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty<br> determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance<br> alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white<br> teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing<br> items.

### Society and Culture
Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with literal regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.

### Names
Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.

**Full Names.** Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior

**Nicknames.** Galan, Meela, Wilpher

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:320px'></div>

### Squib Traits
As a Squib, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Squibs reach adulthood at nine years of age and live an average of sixty-five years.

***Alignment.*** Squibs' cheerful nature causes them to<br> tend toward the light side, though there are<br> exceptions.

***Size.*** Squibs typically stand 3 to 3 and a half feet tall and weigh around 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Bite.*** Your sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.

***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Squibs is their desire and love of haggling. Squibs believe a deal is done when both sides believe they got the better of the other. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

***Flexible Cheeks.***  Squibs have flexible cheeks in<br> which they can store small goods. You can store up to<br> two items that weigh a combined total of no more than<br> 2 lb. in your cheeks, and you have advantage on<br> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal<br> them.

***Hide.*** Your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Sensitive Fur.*** Squibs' fur is exceptionally sensitive to physical details. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on touch.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Squibbian. The Squibbian language originated as a secret form of communication for Squibs to convey information without being understood.

### Biology and Appearence
A diminutive species of near-Humans, Sullustans bear round, tapered skulls. Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears. Their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision. Due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. Many choose to wear special visors to prevent further damage. Some Sullustans tattoo their heads as a form of individual expression.

### Society and Culture
Sullustans are outgoing and mercantile, friendly and pragmatic. As a species they are altogether lacking in xenophobia. Though fond of practical jokes and extremely shrewd in their business dealings, they are eager to explore and travel the galaxy. Inquisitive by nature, some have described Sullustans as reckless, especially for their preference to learn and discover whenever possible through personal experience. Sullustans organize themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each clan consists of one polyandrous female, several husbands, and their young. Unmated females, known as "Fems", are active members of their communities until they reach breeding status, called "Ready", when they choose their mates.

### Names
Male names are typically longer than female names. Surnames are based on Warren-clan.

**Male Names.** Duedt, Oshror, Partheen, Throthinnitz

**Female Names.** Asulu, Eldo, Tri, Vo, We

### Biology and Appearence
Talz are large, bulky, bipedal creatures, that are covered head to toe in thick white fur, which provides exceptional insulation against their frozen world. Talz have four eyes, which are also adaptations to their native environment. The larger set of eyes are shut during the day, when sunlight reflects off the snow with dazzling brightness—able to blind sensitive optical organs—leaving the smaller set to navigate with. Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld's moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.

### Society and Culture
Talz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society. They work in unison, and treat the entire clan as one single familial entity. Resources on Ordo Plutonia are often scarce, which leads to warring among Talz tribes. However, the clans are adept at forming a unified front when they face a common enemy.

Talz are large, brutal creatures and are often used as guards and enforcers. Sometimes they are taken as slaves, though it's rare; they are rebellious against authority and don't take well to slavery. There are rumors that Talz are captured for scientific experimentation.

### Names
Talz names are fairly gutteral and are characterized by their harsh nature. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are clan-based, though it's rare that a Talz shares them with non-Talz.

**Male Names.** Drak, Fedirk, Imom, Ke, Twift

**Female Names.** Ilnuno, Ontuga, Utrukk, Zimtucc

**Surnames.** Dic, Noetoc, Suptat, Wume, Zapak

### Society and Culture
Togorians have a unique cultural division between<br> their sexes. They evolved as nomadic hunters of<br> creatures like the bist and etelo, surviving on the<br> wilderness as apex predators. As time went on, a rift in<br> their society developed between the two sexes. Males<br> were drawn to continue their lifestyle as nomads and<br> hunters for their people, while females tended to<br> prefer remaining in permanent camps and contributed<br> the vast majority of their species technological<br> developments. This division has continued into<br> modern times, with males continuing their nomadic<br> traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in<br> villages and cities. Males visit their mates for about a<br> month each year, but otherwise the sexes live<br> completely separate lives. Whether in spite of this<br> separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are<br> typically monogamous and devoted to their chosen<br> mates.

### Names
Togorian names tend to be short and primal-sounding. Female names tend to include softer consonants and more vowels, while male names are typically harsher. Togorians do not use surnames.

**Male Names.**  Mezgraf, Mlatar, Morto, Mrrov, Torr

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
A mammalian species of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians have stubby facial tusks which protruded from their lower jaw and framed a short pudgy trunk. While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. 

### Society and Culture
Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. 

Toydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.

### Names
Toydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there. Male names are generally shorter than female names. Female names always end in a vowel. 

**Male Names.** Dod, Nesteddo, Tul, Zloomroo

**Female Names.** Fefiffe, Lenlibo, Nugni, Zoldibu

**Surnames.** Daab, Faabb, Kepo, Mitra, Vulba

\columnbreak

***Size.*** Toydarians average 4 feet tall and weigh less than 50 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Business Savvy.*** A common trait of all Toydarians is their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.

***Closed Mind.*** Toydarian brains have an unusual composition which made them resistant to influence from the Force. You have advantage on saving throws against force powers.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed of 25 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

<div style='margin-top:95px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
While Tuskens, also known as Tusken Raiders or Sand People, are easily recognizable by their full-body clothing, goggles, and mouth filters, little of their true physical appearance can be discerned. From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.

### Society and Culture
Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.

Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.

### Names
Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds. Tuskens do not use surnames.

**Male Names.** Ur Ur, A'Koba, Qeruru'rr, Gr'Karr

**Female Names.** K'Yark, Reirin, K'Orou, Ursarr'u

### Tusken Traits
As a Tusken, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength or Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Tuskens are considered adults when they turn 15. Because of the harsh and unforgiving climate of their home world, they rarely live longer than half a century.

***Alignment.*** Tusken culture's violent focus and disregard of those outside the tribe causes them to tend towards chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Tusken stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh around 155 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

***Animal Handler.*** You are proficient in Animal Handling. 

***Intimidating Roar.*** Once per day, you can cast the *fear* force power. Charisma is your forcecasting ability for this power.

***Survivors of the Sands.*** You are proficient in Survival. Additionally, you don't treat desert terrain as difficult terrain. Lastly, you are naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Tusken Weaponry.*** You have proficiency with the slugthrower and vibroclub. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Tusken. Tusken is a guttural language characterized by its barks, growls, and roars. While Tuskens typically understand Galactic Basic, it is rare to hear them speak anything but Tusken.

### Biology and Appearence
Ugnaughts are diminutive, porcine humanoids who have pink skin, upturned noses, white hair, and thick layers of jowls. Some have tusks that they use in blood duels. They are strong and resilient, and their life-spans reached up to 200 standard years. They notably eat genteslugs.

### Society and Culture
Ugnaughts are ruled by councils comprised of elected officers. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their "blood profession", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.

When greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting "yaa-yaah" is considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurrs, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements will be thrown one's way. 

Ugnaughts are often enslaved as they are fairly<br> meek.

### Names
Ugnaught names are generally concise. Female names sound more cheerful. Surnames are determined by blood profession.

**Male Names.** Banax, Dral, Durn, Togre, Yirkux

<div style='margin-top:95px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Umbarans, called the "Shadow People" by some, are a<br> near-human species characterized by their pale, bluish<br> skin and colorless, sunken eyes. Their homeworld,<br> Umbara, is situated deep within the Ghost Nebula, and<br> receives almost no direct light from the planet's<br> primary star. As a result, Umbaran eyes are well-<br>adjusted to seeing in low light, and can see into the<br> ultraviolet spectrum, but can be disoriented by bright<br> light.

### Society and Culture
Umbaran society is strictly divided into a leveled caste system, with most Umbarans constantly scheming to improve their social rank, using tactics such as blackmail, subterfuege, and even assassination if necessary. Only those within the ten highest caste tiers were given opportunities to leave their homeworld. Because of the cutthroat machinations required to get there, Umbarans in the wider galaxy are known as skilled, ruthless politicians. This reputation is enhanced by the Umbarans' talents for reading and influencing the emotions of others.

Umbara developed its own technological advances separate from galactic society, and possessed technology that was in many fields far more advanced than the galactic standard. 

### Names
Umbaran names are typically no more than one or two syllables. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Mee, Pir, Nyss, Moshenu  

**Female Names.** Sly, Syll, Myn, Sata 
 
**Surnames.** Deechi, Moore, Phobi, Nenn

<div style='margin-top:82px'></div>

### Biology and Appearence
Verpine are thin bipedal insectoids whose heads are dominated by large compound eyes. They also have two antennae, one located behind each eye. Their hardened carapace, composed of a green chitinous substance called carahide, is as flexible as the skin of other creatures, yet tough enough to deflect a blade or even absorb a glancing blaster bolt. The Verpine circulatory system does not contain a heart.

Verpine eyes are keen enough to pick out microscopic details. Their antennae contain tympanic nerves which pick up sound. Their antennae are also sensitive to radio waves, giving Verpine the natural ability to sense and transmit radio waves to communicate with another Verpine in their language over long distances.

### Society and Culture
The Verpine people hail from the Roche asteroid field, which is the fractured remnants of their home planet. The Roche live in artificial, self-sustaining environments inside these fragments.

Verpine culture is oriented around crafting; they are noteworthy manufacturers of weapons, shield generators, armor, as well as personal use items such as breathing apparatuses. They are also gifted pilots.

### Names
Verpine had variable naming customs. Not all Verpines adopt surnames. Male and female Verpine names do not differentiate.

**First Names.** Fxz'et, Kuli, Moegid, Ss's, Zix

**Surnames.** And'et, Ned'Ix, Ned'lx, Niskooen, Zes'sx

### Biology and Appearance
Voss are humanoid sentients with a high rate of Force-sensitivity who display prominent sexual dimorphism. The male Voss have blue skin and bright orange eyes, while the females have red skin and azure eyes. The Voss do not have hair or distinct pupils, and posess unique patterns of markings on their face, neck, and body, a trace of their shared ancestry with Gormak. Their voices have a slight mechanical tinge to them, making them sound somewhat like a droid or machine. Voss undogo a physical, developmental change during their marriage ceremonies (known as the Rite of Ardor) and do not develop sexually prior to the performance of these rituals.

### Society and Culture
The Voss species resides in the isolated mountain-top city of Voss-Ka and is vastly outnumbered on their homeworld by its other native sentient species, the Gormak, who are extremely hostile toward them and from whom they arose. Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style. The entire Voss society is guided by the Force visions of Voss Mystics, which are considered infallible without exception.

### Names
All Voss have two short names, connected by a hyphen, with the family name being the second one.

**Male Names.** Char, Edan, Fadith, Nodin, Orin

**Female Names.** Amin, Magra, Tala, Weylin, Yana

**Surnames.** -Ko, -La, -Po, -Rae, -Va

### Biology and Appearance
Vurks are the predominant sentient species of the planet Sembla. They are tall, reptilian humanoids with bulbous dark eyes and sweeping head crests. Their hands and feet have three digits each, one of which was opposable. They have distinguishing gray-green, leathery skin. Being able to breathe both water and air, they are perfectly adapted to travel Sembla's warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They share a strong nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors.  

### Society and Culture
Young Vurk males are married off by their parents; those who failed to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives. Because their way of living resulted in virtually no sizable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were generally considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy; however, that was not true. They are very intelligent and believe in a highly developed philosophical tradition that emphasizes personal integrity and individual freedom and encourage personal honesty. Their compassionate and calm manner made them better than average diplomats.

Vurks are very family-oriented. It is common for multiple generations to remain in the same location as a single household, with the eldest family member being the patriarch or matriarch and making the decision for the entire family.

### Names
Vurk names are traditionally two to three syllables. Female names typically end with a vowel, while male names vary. Surnames are familial.

**Male Names.** Coleman, Jadran, Milanko, Zlatko

**Female Names.** Elka, Iryna, Miglena, Tanya, Verka

**Surnames.** Cheevochik, Provric, Trebor, Vorgecz

<div style='margin-top:50px'></div>

### Biology and Appearance
Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.

### Society and Culture
Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.

Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.

### Names
Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.

**Male Names.** Chublu, Fah, Kreakk, Og-Rollo, Yurrenn

**Female Names.** Gila, Qommi, Palsa, Sex, Xelror

**Surnames.** Britreg, Dlur, Klanz, Maub, Semu

### Weequay Traits
As a Weequay, you have the following special traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Weequay reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Weequay ruthlessness and greed cause them to tend toward chaotic dark side, though there are exceptions.

***Size.*** Weequay typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Charming.*** You have proficiency in Deception or Persuasion.

***Darkvision.*** Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Keen Smell.*** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Tanned.*** You have tough, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Sriluurian. You can communicate with other Weequay without speaking through use of pheromones. Force attuned individuals can detect the communication but can't understand it.
