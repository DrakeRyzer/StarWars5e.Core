## Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Auto
Automatic weapons can only fire in burst mode.

#### Disintegrate
When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described to below.

#### E-Web
Rather than traditional power cells, the E-Web uses specialized power generator that allow it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a battery pack takes an action.

The E-Web requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can
deploy or collapse the E-web on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.

#### Grenade Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

#### Interchangeable Weapons System
The IWS is a heavy weapon that can fire in there different modes. As a bonus action, you can switch between each mode, detailed below. Each mode contains and uses its own power source.

***Antiarmor.*** While in this mode, rather than traditional power cells, the IWS fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade's explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

***Blaster.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

***Sniper.*** While in this mode, the weapon uses traditional power cells.

#### Needler
The needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.

#### Rocket Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets.

#### Vapor Projector
The vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank�s effects. The DC for this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

### Ammunition

#### Power Generator
Power generators energize the E-web blaster.

#### Projector Tank, Flame
A flame projector tank is a type of ammunition for the vapor projector. When triggered, it produces a burst of flame in a 15 foot cone. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage.

Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage and have its speed halved until the end of your next turn. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.

#### Rocket, Fragmentation
The fragmentation rocket is the most common ammunition type for the rocket launcher. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 kinetic damage. Hit or miss, the rocket then explodes. The target and each creature within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier), taking 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a succesful one.

#### Rocket, Ion
The ion rocket is a specialized ammunition type for the rocket launcher. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 kinetic damage. Hit or miss, the rocket then explodes. The target and each creature within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier), taking 3d4 ion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a succesful one. Any electronics within the blast radius that aren�t being worn or carried are disabled until rebooted.

#### Rocket, Plasma

## Equipment

#### Gravity Generator
Gravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

#### Shock Gloves
A shock glove is a type of armored glove<br> that is coated with a webbed lacing. When<br> used for an attack, this webbing carries a charge that deals 1d4 lightning damage to any objects that the glove come in contact with. If you are engaged in combat with the target of the attack, you must make a grapple check instead of an attack roll, using a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target�s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
