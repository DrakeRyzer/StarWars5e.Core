## Credits
First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.

Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.

Lastly, while I would love to say that I created *everything* in this conversion, that wouldn't be *entirely* true. The following people deserve credit as well:

___

#### The SW5e Jedi Council:
Karbacca for the *epic* cover and SW5e logo<br>
LordAelfric for the awesome theme<br>
Stormchaser6 for his help with the Starships book<br>
DarkMesa for writing almost as many archetypes as I<br> &emsp;have at this point<br>
Speedreeder for the epic new website<br>
Grelite for all his help with editing and creation<br>
Tomato-andrew for his immense help with the<br> &emsp;enhanced items<br>
Fynikz for his help overhauling and implementing new<br> &emsp;powers<br>
