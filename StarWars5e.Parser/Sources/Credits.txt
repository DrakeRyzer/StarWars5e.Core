## Credits
First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.

Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.

Lastly, while I would love to say that I created *everything* in this conversion, that wouldn't be *entirely* true. The following people deserve credit as well:

___

#### The /r/sw5e mod team:
&emsp;Karbacca for the *epic* cover and SW5e logo<br>
&emsp;LordAelfric for the awesome theme<br>
&emsp;Stormchaser6 for his help with the Starships book<br>
&emsp;DarkMesa for writing almost as many archetypes as I have at this point<br>
&emsp;Speedreeder for the epic new website<br>

#### The rest of the Jedi Council:
&emsp;Grelite for all his help with editing and creation<br>
&emsp;Tomato-andrew for his immense help with the enhanced items<br>
&emsp;Fynikz for his help overhauling and implementing new powers<br>
&emsp;Playking57 for his help with the artwork<br>
&emsp;DrakeRyzer for his work on polishing factions and ships<br>
&emsp;Toddmoonbounce for his help getting the book ready for printing<br>
&emsp;Legobis for creating a whole bunch of monsters<br>

#### The Website Team:
&emsp;Speedreeder and Tyrzaphir
