## Credits
First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.

Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.

Lastly, while I would love to say that I created *everything* in this conversion, that wouldn't be *entirely* true. The following people deserve credit as well:

___

Karbacca for the *epic* cover and SW5e logo

LordAelfric for the awesome theme 

Stormchaser6 for his help with the Starships book

DarkMesa for writing almost as many archetypes as I have at this point

Speedreeder for the epic new website

___

The rest of the Jedi Council:

Grelite for all his help with editing and creation

Tomato-andrew for his immense help with the enhanced items
