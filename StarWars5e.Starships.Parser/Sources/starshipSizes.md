While an astromech droid occupies the interface slot, they function as a deployed crew member, rolling their own initiative and taking their own actions as long as they are not incapacitated. Additionally, deployed crew members can draw on it to enhance one action they take. When a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can roll an Astromech Synergy die, which is a d4, and add it to the roll.

## Medium Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite</span> its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a terrible volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of standing such a salvo, disable the tractor beam and retreat.

The atmosphere set, the captain invites his guests into the cantina. Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he gestures for the starry-eyed visitors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks, as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident that this deal will go in his favor.

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close-knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

## Huge Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The battleship's shields flickers as it absorbs the blows of the</span>  attacking fighters. It continues inexorably past them, approaching the fragile medical frigate they scramble to protect, before unleashing a fierce volley and snapping it in half.

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy in formations and move to intercept. Before the enemy craft has the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks.

With the command given, the operator activates the interdictor's gravity well projectors. Accompanied by a low-pitched hum, the gravity well projectors power up. Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them. The ship then activates its tractor beam, trapping its quarry.

Huge starships, regardless of their specific purpose, are the backbone of any military. They provide a mobile base of operations and function as a staging ground for the faction that controls them.

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
You can increase your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. At 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier you may increase one ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can�t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Additional Hit Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hit Die. It gains 1 additional Hit Die at 2nd tier (2), 3rd tier (3), 4th tier (4), and 5th tier (5).

#### Additional Modifications
Your ship gains 5 additional modification slots. It gains 5 additional modification slots at 2nd tier (10), 3rd tier (15), 4th tier (20), and 5th tier (25).

### Superior Firepower
Also at 1st tier, your starship's firepower can overwhelm larger ships.

When a deployed gunner deals damage to a Large or larger ship with a ship weapon, the gunner can increase the damage by rolling a Superior Firepower die, which is a d4, and add it to the damage roll (no action required).

Your ship's Superior Firepower die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 5 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship 
Your ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 250 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 250 feet away for your ship and your ship's shields are active, they instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your shield to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.

#### Command Ship
Your ship gains the Command Center suite and Scanner modifications, which do not count against its total modifications or suite systems. Additionally, when a coordinator deployed in a command center takes the Direct action, the target of the Direct action can reroll one of the dice once.

#### Warship
Your ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

### Prime Doctrine
Also at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When a deployed coordinator rolls initiative, they can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crew member deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + the coordinator's proficiency bonus + their Charisma modifier). On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Versatile Dreadnought
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 5 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Superweapon
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 10d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship
The protective radius of your ship's shields increases to 500 feet, and your shield regeneration rate doubles.

#### Command Ship
A deployed coordinator can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five deployed crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

#### Warship
When a deployed gunner on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.

### Citadel
Also at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled. Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crew members, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion.

### Paragon Dreadnought
As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Two of your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (your choice) increase by 4, and the other ability score increases by 2. Its maximum for the chosen scores increases by 4, and for the other ability score by 2.

### Devastator
Also at 5th tier, as an action, a deployed crew member can give the ship the following benefits for 1 minute:
- Your ship has resistance to all damage.
- Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.
